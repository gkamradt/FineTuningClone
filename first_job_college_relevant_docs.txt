Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good question. I would say that there's kind of 2 Pivotal pivotal moments. My 1st role out of school. So I'm a fresh fresh out of undergrad, very green in the workplace. And I started my career off in corporate FP and A. And that means I was doing finance and budgets for big corporations in their, their departments. Right? I remember getting an Excel spreadsheet. This was back before Google drive or links or anything like that. So it was just a big massive dirty un version controlled spreadsheet. And, there was a list of transactions throughout the entire page and, you know, call it something like a 100,000 transactions or whatever, more rows than I could count, more columns than I could see. And my boss was basically like, Greg, you tell us what tell us X, Y, Z. Like, I forgot what the question was, but they were like, go figure out the answer within the spreadsheet. And I found that I had a knack for digging into Excel spreadsheets and extracting an answer. Now that may sound a little silly, but if you think about most data out there, it's in tabular form. So that was planting the seeds for me to jump into data analysis, early in my career. Now that was pivotal moment number 1. Number 2 is was around 2015. I found a PDF and it was intro to data science for programmers. And In that PDF, which was basically like an old school tutorial, it taught you how to implement a recommendation system from scratch. Now nothing fancy here, But with elementary Python, implement a recommendation system. And I didn't know Python beforehand. So I was learning Python for the 1st time and what recommenders were at the at the same time. And I remember that my mind was just blown with how cool this stuff was. I was like, oh my goodness, you can extract Recommendations from simple code and simple math that wasn't confusing. And so I did all the exercises in that PDF, and that was a huge Kind of turning point in my career because I went further down the data
