Because as a consumer myself, I will gladly, love the benefit of them battling for my"}, {"input": "Who are you and could you tell me about your professional background and current involvement in AI applications?", "output": "Yes. Absolutely. Well, I tell you what. 1st of all, thank you very much for having me for the for the conversation today. My name is Greg Kamrad, and my background is actually in b two b products. So I'm an ex Salesforce person, and I worked out on the growth team at Salesforce. And I led growth for sales and service cloud. And then after that, I was the 1st business hire at Digits, which was a Fintech Series C company. And I was the 1st, operations hire. So, basically, anything that involved spreadsheet, and the business was up to me. However, this year, I've been knee deep in helping others learn how to build AI applications mainly with the Langchain library."}, {"input": "What motivates you as a content creator, particularly in the field of AI and tool building?", "output": "Yeah. So my Preference as a creator is about connecting the content and teaching others how to build impactful tools. Because in my history with my career so far, The most satisfaction that I've gotten and the most efficiency that I've gained has been building my own tools. So whether it's, building a lead score, whether it's building a small automation script, whether it's something in Excel or whatever it may be. So when I saw that AI was coming around, I saw a lot of opportunity to build some really cool tools that would impact me. However, I wanted to teach others how to build those tools for themselves and so they could have the impact. And I found that the best way to do that was through creating tutorial content and getting people started from the ground up."}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on the current buzz about AI technology, particularly in relation to ChatGPT? Can you also provide some historical context and examples of how it's been used?", "output": "Well, I think the reason why there's so much buzz now is because for any new technology to get adequately adequately adopted, you need the story along with it. And the amazing thing about what's happening with AI is it's text in, text out. And a 5 year old can put text in, a seasoned software developer can put text in, or your grandmother could put in text. And so the just the the generalized nature of ChatGPT in in the 1st place, I think, was massive for the adoption. Right? Now if we take a look back, ChatGPT came out at the end of October, early November 2022. And Yes. At the beginning, people were just making poems about their cats. You know? They were trying to figure out, like, Christmas presents should to go and get people. I think that the really, really cool stuff started to happen once people understood that, no, you can actually use language models not only for text generation, but also as a reasoning engine, as a classification engine. And it has really, really wide general capabilities, which is has been really cool to see the, see how the community has been developing on it on top of it."}, {"input": "Can you explain what a large language model is and give some examples of what it can do?", "output": "Absolutely. So The in extremely simple language, think of a large language model as a really good predictor of the next word. Right? And so if it is the day that you were born, and I come to you and I say, happy, you know that I'm likely gonna say birthday coming up next. Right? A language model is the same exact thing, and it is gonna predict the next word. Now what has been really, really awesome is the emergent behavior that comes from that from those capabilities. So just because you're predicting the next word, you might first think, well, how smart could it actually be? Right? What's really cool is you can ask these language models to generate you a poem. You can ask it to read a financial statement. You can ask it to answer a question about a piece of text. Right? You can also ask a language model. Hey. I have 2 routes that I could take. Should I go left or should I go right? And it will actually intelligently understand your situation and suggest a route to take. And a really big topic that we're seeing these language models take on right now is the concept of agents. And you can think of agents as an autonomous decision maker. So just from the emergent behavior predicting the next word, we get smart agents that are capable of thinking and going through it."}, {"input": "What is your perspective on the potential misuse of AI by malicious entities and how do you see the future of AI technology?", "output": "Yeah. I see AI just as another technology that's coming through. So you could say the same thing about the Internet. You could say the same thing about electricity. If bad actors got ahold of this technology, then they're gonna do it. They're gonna do something wrong with it. Right? I believe that, Yes. There is the ability for bad actors to cause to do things with AI that, may not be beneficial to the rest of the world. But with that pressure with that pressure comes the other side of the coin too. There are a lot of people who want to do good with AI. So, yes, the bad actors will get their capabilities, uplifted, but also the good folks and law enforcement and governments will also have AI that they can battle back and push with on those. So I don't see it as a one-sided sword here. It's gonna be double sided. And I personally am not am not worried about it. And I think that one of the biggest things that you can do to to develop advancement is to have a large incentive. Now usually incentive can come through those forms of, monetary incentive or societal pressure from it. Now when you have such negative consequences on the brink and it could actually happen, then, that's pretty good incentive to come up with good AI alignment and make sure that it's working out okay."}, {"input": "What is your opinion on tech companies potentially breaking laws in certain countries by not getting consent from users in their haste to launch new products or services?", "output": "Yeah. You know, you would hope that they're following the regulations of the localized country that they're choosing to deploy in. However, the reality of it is is all these companies are taking calculated risks for how they wanna proceed and move forward with it. So if they choose not to get consent from the user because they wanna go faster, that's their choice. However, they are gonna be breaking the law in some countries. And as long as they're okay with that risk, they will still continue to do it. The old saying move fast and break things, I know it's gotten a little bit of slack over the past couple years. I don't necessarily endorse it, but I do know a lot of companies that will choose to move fast and try to find product could fit first before they worry about legal legal regulations and compliance."}, {"input": "What are your priorities when it comes to the types of developments you're doing right now?", "output": "Yeah. You know, it it's it's always a balance. Of course. I mean, every every business has different priorities for it. For the types of developments that I do right now, I'm not worried about handing over sensitive data, and I'm worried about cost, latency and intelligence. And in fact, if I were to prioritize those intelligence, latency, and then cost. So I want something that's really smart, really fast, and then eventually that it's cheap. I don't for my types of developments right now, I'm not worried about sensitive data. I'm worried about building really impactful products and making sure that value is there. Now with regards to open source, yes, open source is tough to compete with because there's the collective, intelligence of humanity on those. Yes. However"}, {"input": "What is your opinion on the effectiveness of open source models compared to closed ones, and do you think open source models will ever catch up or surpass the performance of something like GPT 4?", "output": "The benchmarks all show that open source aren't as good as the closed models. And so I was just Interviewing Siki Chen the other day. He's the co he's the founder and CEO of, Runway. He said that he believes that Open source models will always be about 18 months behind closed source models. So will we ever see an open source model that's as good as GPT 4? Absolutely. 100%. It's just a technology problem. Time solves technology problems. Well, innovation solves technology problems."}, {"input": "What are your predictions for the development of OpenAI and other open source models in the next 18 months?", "output": "However, in that 18 months when when those open source models are getting better, OpenAI is gonna improve their capabilities. They're gonna come out with good stuff, and they're gonna be on a GPT 5, 6, whatever."}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on OpenAI's success with GPT-4, particularly in comparison to Google's efforts?", "output": "Yeah. It's a good question. 1st, a reaction on the quote that you had mentioned. It is kind of romantic and beautiful that to think how hard it is to come up with an if you were to try to mimic GPT 4 today, it would take a substantial amount of work and people and money to end up doing it. Right? Not only that, it would take a ton of coordination to do it as well. So what's amazing is Why doesn't Google have something that benchmarks as good as GPT 4? Google has all the money in the world. They have more researchers than they know what to do with, but yet they they still haven't done it yet. Or they haven't released it at full scale yet. So OpenAI has done something pretty something pretty special to be able to combine all those boxes and bring it out together. And I really I'm a capitalist at heart, and so I love market pressure. And so I love the fact that that there are multiple model providers all battling for consumer value and consumer attention. Because as a consumer myself, I will gladly Love the benefit of them battling for my own business."}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence, specifically in the context of a language model for a financial startup?", "output": "Yeah. Absolutely. Well, I remember talking earlier around the generality of AI and how good it is as adapting to a lot of different use cases. And it also storytells really well. Oh my god. It's gonna change the world, or, oh my god. It's gonna automate away, you know, x, y, z job. The fact of the matter is is that there are early promises of some really cool things. It's not a it's not a magic wand. It's not gonna do every single thing that you want, for you. And there are a series of things, that it's not good at, explicitly. So one time, a, a a pair of cofounders came to me, And they were running a finance startup. And they asked me, hey, Greg. Can you help us create a intelligent AI model that will do financial forecasting for us. And what they wanted to do was pass in a table of numbers to the language model, have it do some complicated interactions, and then have it pass back a table of numbers. And the fact of the matter is is that's not a task that it's very good at. It's good at some it's good at reasoning abilities. It's good at language task, language digestion. And, so there are gonna be more capabilities in the future that help with those types of things. But the main message I wanna send is it's not a magic wand and it really invests or really pays off to invest in understanding what a language model is good at and what it's not good at."}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on the importance of human connection in business and how it compares to AI and automation?", "output": "Yeah. I think you're absolutely right. And what we're talking about here is we're talking about connection down in the 1st place. Human to human human to human connection on it. There's a reason why people don't like cold emails. It's because it was sent by a bot. It was not personalized. It's not authentic, and there's no connection that comes with it. So I agree with you. And it's interesting because when I was talking to Siki, I I mentioned that interview earlier, he I asked him what motes and differentiators he thought companies were gonna have in the future. And one of them was relationships. And so you there's no substitute for relationships. The relationship that I have with you or with my audience or whoever it may be. That's something that AI cannot pull away from however, smart or intelligent, it may be."}, {"input": "Do you believe that big companies like OpenAI benefit from the open source community, and if so, how?", "output": "You know, I would say. Let's talk about 2 different personas here. So if you're a big company like open AI, yes, 100%. Because think about all the features that they've come out with. They wouldn't have known how to prioritize their product roadmap unless the open source community was demonstrating their work on the demand about how this, technology should be used in the 1st place. Alright. Now what I mean by that is Sam Alden talks about the collective intelligence. The reason why they release things on a slow basis is because they want to piecemeal their technology to see how the community reacts with it. Because you're gonna get the ethical people. You're gonna get the hackers. You're gonna get the new people. You're gonna get enterprise. You're gonna get fortune 500, all pushing on this technology. And you wanna make sure that you do it in the right way. So I'm a really big fan of open source community. And when I say that, I just mean people building in public and sharing their work. So I'm a really big fan of people doing that and people sharing because that helps our collective intelligence grow in the 1st"}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on giving advice to others versus making decisions for your own situations?", "output": "And isn't it weird how you can give someone else advice and if you looked at someone else and they had your situation, you'd be like, it's a no brainer on what you should do. You need to do x, y, and z. But when it's your own situation, you get almost tunnel vision or you get, you know, almost like the fog of war, and it's really tough to have a fresh perspective. So That's why it's so good talking to people on the outside who have that fresh perspective and who can tell you with a bit more clarity on what to do."}, {"input": "What has been your experience working with data in your career?", "output": "Awesome. Yeah. You know, it's been a journey. I've been in and out of data for most of my career, so I'm excited to see, to talk"}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on the correlation between the increase in tool supply and the rise of people's expectations in terms of value?", "output": "Yeah. That's exactly. I think the tide would rise for what value means relative value, at least because once you have an influx of a supply of tools, which is really cool, the, the, Everyone's expectations will be higher as well."}, {"input": "What drives your ambition and entrepreneurial spirit, and how has growing up in Silicon Valley influenced your approach to your projects and career?", "output": "I think comes from, You know, I saw a quote from, Andrew Wilkinson that said something along the lines of like, a successful person is just A walking anxiety trait used for productivity or something like that. Or basically, you know, I think it's it comes from 2 things. 1 is a genuine curiosity for how things work. But then, 2, I grew up in Silicon Valley. And with that, you have a lot of success stories that you grow around you, whether it's your friends, whether it's your, whether it's your friends' parents. And so I think that the, The crap, not the crowd, but the kind of the atmosphere that I grew up in as well has always been one where you try things and you're building things and you're sharing things. And And then the minute you get hooked into that world and you jump into the entrepreneurial social media type of space, the number one thing people say you wanna build in public. You wanna build anything. You just wanna ship it out. So I think that it was early on just growing up in the Bay and then eventually just started to snowball and go from there. Now, It may look cool from the outside too. And I think I have a lot of small kind of mini hobby projects that have gone well, and I'm looking for, like, Bigger projects that will be career defining as well. But I tell you what, it's a big long journey and we're having fun along the way."}, {"input": "Can you describe the feelings you had about your work as a content creator before and after you gained a significant audience and success?", "output": "Do you do you think you honed in on that feeling after you found success as a creator?

And I was gonna say that I was gonna say the thing that just to tack onto that is We talk about expected value of it too. That's the other side of the coin. The expected value of me becoming a decision maker at Salesforce is pretty high if you just follow down the track. Right? What What you're talking about with the startup problem, yes, you can become a decision maker quicker, but your expected value of Success is so much lower that it's a it's a complete different side of the coin."}, {"input": "Can you share an experience where storytelling or copywriting played a significant role in your career progression?", "output": "Yeah. That's exactly it. And in fact, I got my startup job via a cold email to the founder, which is like a 4 line cold email, which, you know, the other big lesson within my career that I've seen is around storytelling. Right? And it's amazing the power of storytelling and copywriting and what it can do for you. So, you're right when a with a current you're right when you say that the name of Salesforce also helped me out a ton."}, {"input": "What's a memorable story you have from your job search process after leaving Salesforce?", "output": "Yeah. So I was leaning back on the Salesforce name, And I'll tell you I'll tell you right now because this is a this is a good one. Yeah. So I emailed, one of the founders and I said, founder, my My name is Greg, and I was previously director of strategy and growth at Salesforce leading our sales and service analytics teams.

And so the reason Nice."}, {"input": "What was your experience like when you were preparing your resume for the executive team?", "output": "Just nice and short. The resume, sure, because that's just standard. But then I said, do you want me to put bullet points? Because no exec wants to read a resume. I mean, really, they want the TLDR. And so I and then he didn't even respond to the first one. I had to follow-up with him again. And he was like, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's let's see what let's basically see what you got. And so I sent it over to him, and that started"}, {"input": "What strategy did you use to land your job at Salesforce after leaving Zipfian?", "output": "Yeah. Right after I left Zipfian, I did a video about my job searching process and how I landed at Salesforce. And the number 1 lesson throughout that entire thing is Don't apply through the front door. Careers.uber.comcareers.lift.com. That's you're sending your resume into an abyss there. I put all of my energy into cold emails to recruiters and hiring managers. I got more responses and more hit rates from that, than 200 applications into random career pages. It it's just that it's just not the way it works. Oh, yeah. Same goes for LinkedIn. Don't apply on LinkedIn. It just does not does not work at all."}, {"input": "Can you explain your perspective on job hunting and how you would approach diagnosing problems in someone's job search strategy?", "output": "mean, the that type of job hunting is just like a sales funnel. And coming from a growth background, if you break it down just like a funnel, You can see exactly where your problems are. So if somebody tells me they have a hard time getting a job, I just start at the top of the funnel. I say, how's your outbound? What do you mean? What's what do you mean what outbound? Alright. Well, there you go. There's the problem. You know? And then it's like, okay, what's your response rate on your outbound? Oh, you know, it's 1%. Okay. Well, I think that could be a little bit higher. And you just go down. It's, like, how many phone calls have you had with a recruiter? How many have you had with a hiring manager? How many have, you know, 2nd round, you know, blah, blah, blah. And then you can really just diagnose where the problem is. And I would say that most folks, they have a volume problem at the top of the funnel. They're not doing enough outbound. And then it's also a conversion problem on that outbound so their sales pitch or their email or their online persona is not curated enough that recruiters are rejecting them, before they even reply."}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on people sticking to what's easy for them instead of trying out challenging tasks?", "output": "Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And on that point where you said people fall back on what's easy for them. I'm I was on the My First Million podcast, Sam Parr said a line that was just that hit me a lot. He goes, people or looking for excuses as to why something didn't work out for them or something like that. I don't know what it is. They're looking for permission to not put an energy into something. And so if you only do what's easy for you and you don't do what's hard or what's differentiated, you're not gonna end up getting what you want in the 1st place."}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on giving advice to others versus taking your own advice?", "output": "small return.

I'm not technical by trade. Right? I'm not a software engineer. And I tell people all the time, I'm not gonna be your production grade engineer to get you to, you know, 99.99 uptime. Right? My background and my passion is in b two b products and delivering value to customers. So if I'm gonna teach a technical topic, I need it to be dead simple. Like, I need it to speak like English. So some of my code you'll see it right to is not the most optimized. It's gonna be slow, But it's gonna be so simple that you can understand and kinda read it like a book because if I don't have it that simple, then I don't understand it either. So I think that That's another, differentiator that people resonate with with content wise."}, {"input": "What is your approach to teaching Python and who is your target audience?", "output": "Yeah. And every creator too, they have a choice about what type of audience member do they wanna serve. And so I've strategically Not gone to the here's how you install Anaconda. Here's how you install Python. I I let other creators and other people do that stuff. It's once you open a Jupyter Notebook, Let's go. Game on. We're gonna have some fun and and go from there."}, {"input": "Can you explain what Langchain is and what kind of problems it helps to solve?", "output": "Sure. So let me do it at a few different levels of abstraction. Z. Lang, let me put this. Langchain is to what what pandas is to doing data analysis. Langchain is to helping build AI applications. Cool. What is what is Langchain? Langchain is a series of abstractions packaged up in a Python library that makes working with language models easy to do. Right? What is Langchain? Langchain is an easy way to develop AI applications. So what it what it means in I mean, in English here is basically, a lot of the hard parts that you'll run into if you just interact with the OpenAI API, It like the raw one itself or any other language model API, you're gonna quickly run into a series of problems. First one is gonna be context limit. You're gonna try to put in a 50 page book into a prompt. And you're gonna get an error back from the API that says, hey, you tried doing too much here."}, {"input": "What can you tell me about the Langchain library and its contribution to the field of AI and language models?", "output": "So yeah. So what do you do? Oh, well, I'm gonna split up my document and I'm gonna make a 4 loop and then I'm gonna chunk it and then I'm gonna try to put it in piece by piece. Well, instead of you doing that yourself with vanilla Python, there's libraries that are specialized in this and Langchain is one of those. Now Langchain is open source. That means that you can go and check out the code on GitHub yourself. I frequently need to go into their source code and go check out different parameters or whatever whatever it may be. Lang chain was one of the first frameworks out there, and it's Super interesting to see some of the lang chain decisions get permeate per per permeate throughout the industry. So The lang chain was one of the 1st groups to allow you to connect external data sources to a language model. Right? And I don't know how many months Head start they had on it, but then all of a sudden OpenAI has plugins come around and they mentioned Langchain in the plugin blog post launch blog post. Super, super interesting. Right? So Langchain is an what is Langchain? Langchain is an awesome community of builders that is in the forefront of building with AI. And because it's open sourced, you get a lot of really cool integrations and a lot of really cool abstractions that are on the tip of the spear for building language models."}, {"input": "What are you currently working on and what challenges are you facing?", "output": "Yeah. Well, I tell you what, I'm making the script I'm making the script right now. The the biggest pain in the butt with this entire thing is just data processing, getting the files, making sure they're organized, and setting up the structure itself. Then language model part is the easy part. So, let's chat later and we'll we'll try it out."}, {"input": "What are some ways that people can contact you and what types of questions do you typically respond to?", "output": "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's exactly it. And then lastly, if you wanna get a hold of me, my Put our DMs are open. That's where I respond to a whole bunch of people. That's a great spot. If not, you can go on my regular website, which is contact at dataindependent.com. Or lastly, throw up a YouTube comment, but I don't respond to all of them depending on the question from there. But either way, I love talking to folks. And, If somebody gives me a well formulated question, I generally respond. If you throw me your Python bug in a YouTube comment, and you say, why isn't this working? I generally won't respond."}, {"input": "Can you tell me about your journey into data analysis, any early signs you had towards becoming a data nerd, and your first experience with it?", "output": "Yeah. There's 0 signs. Well, maybe you could talk to my parents then. There might have been something there. No. I mean, it's, no. No early signs there. I I can't say that I have an origin story. It all kinda started when I had my 1st job out of school. I was doing corporate FP and A, and what that means is that you're doing big budgets for other companies. Right? And so the very first instance that I knew that I was a spreadsheet minded kind of data nerd was they would give you a list of transactions, and then this just looked like absolute gibberish When I first saw it, and it was a bunch of rows, bunch of, you know, bunch of columns, had no idea how to get into it. And they said, Greg, go extract an insight from this data. And so all of a sudden, it was me needing to dive into the spreadsheet and go pull out a story. Because once you have the numbers, well, then you gotta go present them to people too. And so, I found that I weirdly enjoyed that. I turned into an Excel monkey, and I was using the keyboard, no mouse. And I could really kinda just Feel the spreadsheet and go get good stuff from it. So I would say that was the 1st instance when I knew that, hey, Greg. You should probably lean into this a little bit more."}, {"input": "How did you first get started with creating content on YouTube?", "output": "Yeah. You know? So I guess my first four 4 way 4 way into it was, back in o nine, actually. And I didn't I did tutorials on YouTube, but it wasn't for what you'd think it'd be. It was, it was Photoshop tutorials. Wow. So for some because back then, we're talking old school Photoshop o nine. And photo editing kinda just, like, blew my mind because you had this thing that you think looks static, but then all of a sudden you can apply your creativity and switch the colors and do all this other fun stuff to it. And it was back when photo editing was still hard. So I would teach people how to go do some of the stuff, and I threw it on YouTube. No face, No name. No personal brand. No nothing. I had no idea what I was doing. So those are my first videos, back back in 09. I was And I know I'll date myself a little bit here, but I was 19 at that time doing my 1st videos on YouTube."}, {"input": "Can you describe how YouTube has changed since its early days?", "output": "Oh, yeah.

Where you know, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And the thing that kept the thing that initially turned me on to that, that PDF was I was just tinkering around with stuff. Like Yeah. I was just trying to tinker with data, tinker with a little bit of Python. Like, I had no idea what I'm doing. You know? And, Yeah. And, anyway, so the tinkering got me. It was a good stepping stone to getting forward."}, {"input": "How do you feel about the possibility of being replaced one day?", "output": "You know, I, It's starting like, the whole, like, oh, maybe I'll get replaced. It's like, yeah, one day for sure, But I like to leave those for, like, kinda, like, philosophical conversations around the fireplace"}, {"input": "What's your advice for a college student about to graduate, particularly in the field of data science, who is concerned about being replaced in the job market?", "output": "That type of thing. Like, today, like, Actual. Like, if I'm a college student just about to graduate, what am I doing today? I'm still learning the fundamentals. I mean, I guess if we're talking about data science, still learning the fundamentals of data science. Until there's a tool that comes out there that There there's always gonna be tools that you need to learn to uplevel in your job. Right? If you're worried about getting replaced, that's a rough place to be in. The advice I would give to you is Stay at the forefront of what's coming out for your specific industry. Yeah. If you do get replaced, it's not gonna happen overnight. It's not gonna be like, hey. Monday morning, you don't have a job anymore. It's gonna be a slow transition. And like any competitive professional, and when I say competitive, I just mean somebody who's active in learning in their in their career, You're gonna have to learn the tools. People had to learn computers. They had to learn the Internet. They learned SAS. You know? Anybody who didn't learn the SAS SAS software, or they were anti that. Well, they didn't get by very long, and they're definitely not having fun right now. So, So I'm not worried about anybody getting replaced right now. I think there's ample opportunity for you to upload their skills all over the place."}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on how job functions and workflows are perceived in the workplace?", "output": "Yeah. Yeah. I totally agree. And the other thing too that I think people overlook is A single job function is not a single workflow. Right?"}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on the impact of AI on data scientists' jobs and the role of human intervention in the process?", "output": "Like, even if we were just take a small example, data scientists, where do they get the requirements from? Well, it's usually a stakeholder that they have that tells them what is a priority for the business and what they need to go do. Okay. So is a stakeholder gonna input a prompt and get to get an answer out? No. So the human is also a huge storyteller and interpreter that comes with it. So I think the most likely example is that data scientists, yes, they'll still have their jobs. Some of their mini workflows will get a little speed boost. Right? Just like, DBT comes out and helps people through the ETL process, and it there's a lot of really cool things with it. A lot of people are learning DBT, and now they're speeding up and they're going faster and things like that. So I think the same thing will happen with AI. Like, Hey. Can you go do exploratory data analysis for me? Go give me some good stuff back. Okay. Cool. Now I'm gonna double click myself and do manually, You know, go dive deeper into a section here, but, no one's getting their job replaced overnight."}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on the importance of sharing analysis or insights within an organization?", "output": "That's exact that's exactly and so I another saying I have is, like, Analysis does no good if it just stays on your local computer. Right. Mhmm. Right? It's like even if you came up with the most groundbreaking freaking money making thing analysis. Right? How you infect the org with that insight is also a skill that is, that is hard to do."}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on the role of a data scientist in an organization and the importance of their communication skills?", "output": "Yeah. You're you're you're absolutely right. And You're hinting at something that doesn't get talked about a ton, but you're, I think information asymmetry is a great way to put it because the data person is Extremely intimate with the data, knows how dirty it is, know all knows all the exceptions and everything. An interesting way to look at it though is Is the purpose of the data scientist to recite a number, or is the purpose of the data scientist to implement change within their organization? You know, you're getting paid you're not getting paid to crunch numbers. You're getting paid to guide the product team to go do something, to guide the exec team, to, you know, be an evangelist for the customer within within your org. And so, there is a very, delicate balance between Balancing all those details because there's no right answer, and no stakeholder wants to look at a spreadsheet. They want they want the takeaway. So, like, that's another skill, which Storytelling is a whole another subtopic that I'll probably put in that long form piece too. That's"}, {"input": "Can you tell me about your career progression and personal journey after your time at Salesforce?", "output": "Yeah. So after Salesforce, I had gotten the, director role, And I was managing a team, and, the team that I was on Went through a bit of a turbulent time, and my thought process was a bit more, Not closed minded, shortsighted, I guess you could say. So I the the solution to my unhappiness at work was, Basically, it wasn't like, oh, let's go find another job at Salesforce. It wasn't like you know, I applied to a few other start up jobs to see how I could do it, to see if it would go. And I was I I actually applied to Waymo way back Then and the recruiter, very lovely woman said, you've never done a startup before. Are you sure you can handle it? And it's like, what? What? Who do you think I am? No. No. It's it's whatever. But, so that ended that ended up not working. And then, you know, I was I was with my wife, on a small vacation, like, a week vacation, and We had decided to, go do the travel thing again. Mhmm. And so this is round 2 when when did the travel thing, but this time with my then girlfriend at the time, And we went to Bali, and this time we actually lived in 1 spot for a while. So we're in Bali for, you know, 4 months, and we got a spot and chilled out there for a little bit. The oh, the other difference between this one too is it wasn't just pure travel. I was, working on projects. So I was, like, building apps and, like, you know, coding away and Do you have"}, {"input": "Can you tell me about your professional journey, including why you left Salesforce, what you did in between jobs, and any passion projects you pursued?", "output": "Things like that? It was it was me messing around. Like, I was I was just I was Building Python WebOps. Like, I was just like, I was just doing it. I was just, like, exploring my own, my own curiosities. I started a small side project, small business. That was a good passion project, but it didn't it made a little bit of money, but it wasn't it wasn't much. But, yeah, left Salesforce because, also, I I I was pretty sure I wanted to leave there. But before I got my next job, I wanted to do the travel thing. And, You know, my, then girlfriend, now wife, and I were just, excited to go on this adventure together. And so we ended up doing that. It was fabulous. Like I said, I started a small project where, I started making, you know, those 3 d mountains, like the 3 d relief mountains that people sometimes have Where it's, like, either, like, CNC out of wood. And it's, like, literally, like, a physical people are holding. Yeah. I wanted to make those, but for, but in but in bronze. Right? Impressive. Okay. Yeah. So it's a it's a big long process, but it dealt with a lot of 3 d printing and 3 d modeling, and then I made them over in bronze. There's a whole website"}, {"input": "Can you tell me about your journey in learning manufacturing and how you started your business?", "output": "Well, that's right. That's that's where I started learning the process because it's manufacturing. And so, like, I had no idea how to make these things in the 1st place. And so Bali kicked me off, and I learned all the things not to do when I was in Bali. And then when I came back to California, it was a little bit easier. The website for that is terra mano.co. If anybody wants to go check that out"}, {"input": "What have you been doing since the beginning of COVID?", "output": "Yeah. Good I mean, good question. So, no. I so Like I said, at the beginning of COVID, I did, like, 2 months of the pandas stuff. Right?"}, {"input": "What was your experience when you started creating content about language models on YouTube?", "output": "And I was like, oh, yeah. This is great. And the cool part about language models is that the barrier to entry is super low. It's not a deeply, deeply technical topic, and people are figuring all this stuff out in the beginning, like, just to start. And so I made my 1st video, just a Loom freaking video, you know, going on. Yeah. And I put up on YouTube. It was like an intro to Langchain or, like, Lang chain 101 or whatever. And, that next day, I had I was getting, like, 3 or 4 subscribers a day just off my old content from 2 years ago. And then, I got 16 new subscribers after that LinkedIn video. I was like, oh, that's kinda cool. Mhmm. That's sweet. And then the next day, it was 25. I didn't even put on a new video. It was 25 the next day."}, {"input": "Can you describe the experience when you first started creating content and gaining popularity on your platform?", "output": "like, wait a minute. What? And so I I started pumping out videos, And it went to 45 new subscribers in a day, and then it went to a100. I was like, what is going on here? And I'm telling my wife, I go, babe, this doesn't ever happen. It's like, you have a game for long enough that this does not happen like this. Uh-huh. And so I would say I put my foot on the gas pedal About 30% as much as I probably should have back then. Because, like, if you remember the early 23 hype, I mean, that was just nuts. It was just all over the place. And I started doing stuff. I was full time on it. I was, like, making content. I was really just following my curiosities, like exploring these new things. Right? Right. Like, even the concept of email generation was not it was novel back then."}, {"input": "What was the process or method you used to create a personalized email template for the company?", "output": "And it was take something about the company, Take an email template, and it will output a personal it was novel.

Anyway, so I'm doing that, and it peaked at 550 new subscribers in a day, which, again, isn't a ton, but it was really cool. It was trans transformational at that at that time for me. And so now in August of 23, we're at 33,000 subscribers, and I've told myself that it doesn't get interesting until you until you hit a 100 k.

And so y'all didn't you y'all didn't ask about the evolution of how I approach content because that's changed a whole bunch too. And what what was me just doing tutorials, like, on Loom? I asked myself, Greg, if you wanted to take this to the Level. Like, if you if you really wanna give this a good shot, what do you what do you need to do for it? Right. So there's a there's a whole list of things that I thought about, but that's a different topic, and I don't wanna jump into it if y'all don't wanna take it there."}, {"input": "What are your thoughts on moving forward to the next stage or round?", "output": "Round 2.

Because If we're if you're if I'm really harping on the content side, I mean, content is an equation. Right? You have your audience funnel, but then you also have your content operations funnel. How many ideas can you get? How many of the of those ideas can you execute on? And then how well do those ideas actually end up doing? Right? That's the content side, but then you have your whole, like, audience side, Which is the discovery. I think Jay Klaus puts it as the audience platforms and discovery platforms, and then your relationship platforms, And owning your media, there's just it's so so deep, but Yeah. The operator in me enjoys the game of it all. Like, it it's fun. I mean Yeah.
