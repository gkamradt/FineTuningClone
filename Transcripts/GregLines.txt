Amazing thing about what's happening with AI is it's text in, text out. And a 5 year old can put text in, a seasoned software developer can put text in, or your grandmother could put in text. With regards to open source, yes, open source is tough to compete with because there's the collective, intelligence of humanity on those.

The benchmarks all show that open source aren't as good as the closed models. I'm a capitalist at heart, and so I love market pressure. And so I love the fact that there are multiple model providers all battling for consumer value and consumer attention. Because as a consumer myself, I will gladly, love the benefit of them battling for my

Yes. Absolutely. Well, I tell you what. 1st of all, thank you very much for having me for the for the conversation today. My name is Greg Kamrad, and my background is actually in b two b products. So I'm an ex Salesforce person, and I worked out on the growth team at Salesforce. And I led growth for sales and service cloud. And then after that, I was the 1st business hire at Digits, which was a Fintech Series C company. And I was the 1st, operations hire. So, basically, anything that involved spreadsheet, and the business was up to me. However, this year, I've been knee deep in helping others learn how to build AI applications mainly with the Langchain library.

Yeah. So my Preference as a creator is about connecting the content and teaching others how to build impactful tools. Because in my history with my career so far, The most satisfaction that I've gotten and the most efficiency that I've gained has been building my own tools. So whether it's, building a lead score, whether it's building a small automation script, whether it's something in Excel or whatever it may be. So when I saw that AI was coming around, I saw a lot of opportunity to build some really cool tools that would impact me. However, I wanted to teach others how to build those tools for themselves and so they could have the impact. And I found that the best way to do that was through creating tutorial content and getting people started from the ground up.

Well, I think the reason why there's so much buzz now is because for any new technology to get adequately adequately adopted, you need the story along with it. And the amazing thing about what's happening with AI is it's text in, text out. And a 5 year old can put text in, a seasoned software developer can put text in, or your grandmother could put in text. And so the just the the generalized nature of ChatGPT in in the 1st place, I think, was massive for the adoption. Right? Now if we take a look back, ChatGPT came out at the end of October, early November 2022. And Yes. At the beginning, people were just making poems about their cats. You know? They were trying to figure out, like, Christmas presents should to go and get people. I think that the really, really cool stuff started to happen once people understood that, no, you can actually use language models not only for text generation, but also as a reasoning engine, as a classification engine. And it has really, really wide general capabilities, which is has been really cool to see the, see how the community has been developing on it on top of it.

Absolutely. So The in extremely simple language, think of a large language model as a really good predictor of the next word. Right? And so if it is the day that you were born, and I come to you and I say, happy, you know that I'm likely gonna say birthday coming up next. Right? A language model is the same exact thing, and it is gonna predict the next word. Now what has been really, really awesome is the emergent behavior that comes from that from those capabilities. So just because you're predicting the next word, you might first think, well, how smart could it actually be? Right? What's really cool is you can ask these language models to generate you a poem. You can ask it to read a financial statement. You can ask it to answer a question about a piece of text. Right? You can also ask a language model. Hey. I have 2 routes that I could take. Should I go left or should I go right? And it will actually intelligently understand your situation and suggest a route to take. And a really big topic that we're seeing these language models take on right now is the concept of agents. And you can think of agents as an autonomous decision maker. So just from the emergent behavior predicting the next word, we get smart agents that are capable of thinking and going through it.

Yeah. I see AI just as another technology that's coming through. So you could say the same thing about the Internet. You could say the same thing about electricity. If bad actors got ahold of this technology, then they're gonna do it. They're gonna do something wrong with it. Right? I believe that, Yes. There is the ability for bad actors to cause to do things with AI that, may not be beneficial to the rest of the world. But with that pressure with that pressure comes the other side of the coin too. There are a lot of people who want to do good with AI. So, yes, the bad actors will get their capabilities, uplifted, but also the good folks and law enforcement and governments will also have AI that they can battle back and push with on those. So I don't see it as a one-sided sword here. It's gonna be double sided. And I personally am not am not worried about it. And I think that one of the biggest things that you can do to to develop advancement is to have a large incentive. Now usually incentive can come through those forms of, monetary incentive or societal pressure from it. Now when you have such negative consequences on the brink and it could actually happen, then, that's pretty good incentive to come up with good AI alignment and make sure that it's working out okay.

Yeah. I mean, it's a good question, and I would treat it like any other technology. So before your company allows you to install a Chrome extension, you wanna know what that Chrome extension is doing in the 1st place. Now there's a few layers of this because Chrome itself as a developer store, they need some basic level protection for their consumers on top of their app. They don't want Chrome to be known as the spam place where all the extensions are not providing value. So I think Google has a level of responsibility. Well, I shouldn't say they have responsibility. They have an incentive to make sure that Chrome extensions are healthy for their platform. Right? The 2nd piece is just even before AI. Take AI out of the question. If you're a Fortune 500 company, before you let your employees install a Chrome extension, You're gonna do background checks on what actually this Chrome extension is doing. So you're gonna look at the code, and you're gonna look at the other third party tools that that extension is using. Now the interesting part about language models is that the intelligence is consolidated to a few main players. For the most part, you can run your own open source models, but most of these folks are gonna be using chat GBT. They're gonna be using Bard and Palm from Google and Anthropic and, and all these other model providers. So when you look at these Chrome extensions, it's important to know where your data is going and the, compliance practices of all the third party tools that that Chrome extension's actually using. So if you're if you're worried about OpenAI, they have their data privacy issues you can go check out online.

Yeah. You know, you would hope that they're following the regulations of the localized country that they're choosing to deploy in. However, the reality of it is is all these companies are taking calculated risks for how they wanna proceed and move forward with it. So if they choose not to get consent from the user because they wanna go faster, that's their choice. However, they are gonna be breaking the law in some countries. And as long as they're okay with that risk, they will still continue to do it. The old saying move fast and break things, I know it's gotten a little bit of slack over the past couple years. I don't necessarily endorse it, but I do know a lot of companies that will choose to move fast and try to find product could fit first before they worry about legal legal regulations and compliance.

Yeah. You know, it it's it's always a balance. Of course. I mean, every every business has different priorities for it. For the types of developments that I do right now, I'm not worried about handing over sensitive data, and I'm worried about cost, latency and intelligence. And in fact, if I were to prioritize those intelligence, latency, and then cost. So I want something that's really smart, really fast, and then eventually that it's cheap. I don't for my types of developments right now, I'm not worried about sensitive data. I'm worried about building really impactful products and making sure that value is there. Now with regards to open source, yes, open source is tough to compete with because there's the collective, intelligence of humanity on those. Yes. However

The benchmarks all show that open source aren't as good as the closed models. And so I was just Interviewing Siki Chen the other day. He's the co he's the founder and CEO of, Runway. He said that he believes that Open source models will always be about 18 months behind closed source models. So will we ever see an open source model that's as good as GPT 4? Absolutely. 100%. It's just a technology problem. Time solves technology problems. Well, innovation solves technology problems.

However, in that 18 months when when those open source models are getting better, OpenAI is gonna improve their capabilities. They're gonna come out with good stuff, and they're gonna be on a GPT 5, 6, whatever.

Yeah. You know, a a few things. Companies are worried about data privacy. Yes. But the minute that you use another third party tool, That third party tool is using other people and other tools to to start off in the 1st place. So, yes, people are worried about data privacy with AI, But I think, honestly, it's a it's a story that is needs to be watched out for right now because it's a new paradigm. But people will become used to giving their data to these model providers just like they got used to giving it to Google, giving to Amazon, giving it to Microsoft. Right? So that that's the that's the 1st piece. The 2nd piece is if you're gonna be developing your own language model in today's date, you know, in June 2023, You'd still need to hire either a cons a consulting firm that knows how to do that or a machine learning engineer internally that's gonna help you manage the pipelines and the training and the deployment and the monitoring. And those people are expensive, and they're heavyweight. And they're really, really good at their jobs, but you need to be able to make sure that you have the capital to invest if you're gonna go down that certain direction. So it's in my personal philosophy as putting on my, my operator and business hat is that you should get Your product's working first. Make sure you have product market fit. Make sure the distribution's working. Make sure your customers are loving it. Your storyline works. Then go and invest in other methods that may give you the more privacy that you want or reduce latency or the fine tuning. So making sure that the model is more customized to your use case. But anything before you do all that is a little premature. And, if you're gonna find out that your product doesn't work, I would hope that you would do it sooner rather than later.

Yeah. It's a good question. 1st, a reaction on the quote that you had mentioned. It is kind of romantic and beautiful that to think how hard it is to come up with an if you were to try to mimic GPT 4 today, it would take a substantial amount of work and people and money to end up doing it. Right? Not only that, it would take a ton of coordination to do it as well. So what's amazing is Why doesn't Google have something that benchmarks as good as GPT 4? Google has all the money in the world. They have more researchers than they know what to do with, but yet they they still haven't done it yet. Or they haven't released it at full scale yet. So OpenAI has done something pretty something pretty special to be able to combine all those boxes and bring it out together. And I really I'm a capitalist at heart, and so I love market pressure. And so I love the fact that that there are multiple model providers all battling for consumer value and consumer attention. Because as a consumer myself, I will gladly Love the benefit of them battling for my own business.

Yeah. Absolutely. Well, I remember talking earlier around the generality of AI and how good it is as adapting to a lot of different use cases. And it also storytells really well. Oh my god. It's gonna change the world, or, oh my god. It's gonna automate away, you know, x, y, z job. The fact of the matter is is that there are early promises of some really cool things. It's not a it's not a magic wand. It's not gonna do every single thing that you want, for you. And there are a series of things, that it's not good at, explicitly. So one time, a, a a pair of cofounders came to me, And they were running a finance startup. And they asked me, hey, Greg. Can you help us create a intelligent AI model that will do financial forecasting for us. And what they wanted to do was pass in a table of numbers to the language model, have it do some complicated interactions, and then have it pass back a table of numbers. And the fact of the matter is is that's not a task that it's very good at. It's good at some it's good at reasoning abilities. It's good at language task, language digestion. And, so there are gonna be more capabilities in the future that help with those types of things. But the main message I wanna send is it's not a magic wand and it really invests or really pays off to invest in understanding what a language model is good at and what it's not good at.

Yeah. So one of the questions I ask myself is, what will headcount distribution look like in companies in 5 years? I don't think any department is gonna go away per se, but I think that headcount distribution could change. So the output that a marketing team did with a 100, Maybe just a hypothesis. Maybe you could do the same thing with 75 people, right? Maybe 50 people. I in the interim, what we will see is we'll we will see professions that are augmented by AI. So they help people go faster. Now, really, when you think about jobs reducing, there's 2 pieces of this is, can AI increase the amount of impact and output that the same number of team members have? If so, then. Well, and then the flip side of that is, or do you get the same output, but you want a reduced number of people for it? Now where I'm going with this is let's take salespeople as an example. And you have, let's just say 20 AEs at your company and, they're selling, I'm just gonna make up a round number. They're selling $1,000,000, well, $1,000,000 a month. Right? Let's just use round numbers. With AI, do you expect that $1,000,000 a month to go up? If so, how would that tactically happen? So I think when some people say, oh, we're gonna automate away from a job, we're talking about generalities. They're not talking about specifics. I would love to chat with somebody who thinks that's how it's gonna happen. And then we tactically get down to the nuts and the bolts because is that AI ready to write emails? Are they ready to make human distinction? Are they ready to make judgment calls? Are they ready to insert data into a CRM? There are a lot of things that go into somebody's job in the 1st place. And for that sales example, Sales is a gray area, and there's a lot of colorful creativity that's needed for. So I don't think that any jobs will get replaced today or frankly, even before the end of the year, I would say that we're going to see a transition of roles. So just like how we, how social media marketers, they weren't a thing, you know, I'm gonna call 10 years ago, but in the past 10 years, that's when it started to come around. So there will be some jobs that transitioned. There will be new jobs we'd never even heard of in the 1st place. Like for example, a plug in manager at a Fortune 500 company. I believe that there's gonna be a ton of internal plug ins that LLMs are gonna be talking to, not talking to external data, just internal within the company. And right now the team that would manage that is likely gonna be the ML team, maybe some dev teams, but there's gonna be best practices that somebody needs to pull around and, specialize in, and I wouldn't be surprised if that was a job title in a couple years.

Yeah. I think you're absolutely right. And what we're talking about here is we're talking about connection down in the 1st place. Human to human human to human connection on it. There's a reason why people don't like cold emails. It's because it was sent by a bot. It was not personalized. It's not authentic, and there's no connection that comes with it. So I agree with you. And it's interesting because when I was talking to Siki, I I mentioned that interview earlier, he I asked him what motes and differentiators he thought companies were gonna have in the future. And one of them was relationships. And so you there's no substitute for relationships. The relationship that I have with you or with my audience or whoever it may be. That's something that AI cannot pull away from however, smart or intelligent, it may be.

Yes. So I guess 3 things that I would say first and foremost, get your education 100% see it through because your college degree, your college degree Your college degree helps you out on multiple levels. Not only is it the learning that you're doing, it's the credentials that you have, but it's also a signal to the market that you can complete a task. And that task is a long one. Right? It's really your 1st big, huge responsibility with an educational sense, in your life there. Now is that the answer for everyone? No. But advice is grayscale. And I would go as to say that, like, 90%, 95% of people should just finish the college degree. Okay. Now while you're doing that, though, I'm a huge advocate for side projects, and you going and exploring what interests you. And if you're ever wondering about what to work on, literally just follow your interest. Are you excited about it? What do you wanna learn more about? What do you like reading about? Because That interest will translate into energy, will translate into your ability to do projects. Okay? So my 2nd piece of advice is that I would do by learning. I mean, I'm sorry. I would learn by doing. So if you have a topic you wanna learn about, maybe it's AI, go and build a tool using AI that's interesting to you. That tool could be as simple as a prompt on chat g b t. Go get an account, a free account on chat g b t, go plug in some prompts and go have some fun with it. Alright? Now it gets really interesting when you use chat GPT to help you code or to help you build these applications. There's even no code applications if you don't wanna learn how to code. Go and build projects that interest you. Now my 3rd piece of advice is you need to share your projects. A major differentiation point for students and for people who are rising in the industry is sharing their work. So much like we're all creating content here, we're creating it for a reason so that people can know our name, and we can leverage our ability here. So if I go and create 1 YouTube video and it's viewed by a 1000 people, that's this that's that's as if I gave a tutorial lesson 1 on 1 to a 1000 people. Right? And then I can start to form a relationship with them, and then I can start to build up my differentiation point. So it used to be I used to hate when people used to tell me, oh, Greg, you need to build a portfolio because I was in data analysis. And so people said, you know, Greg, you need to have a data analysis portfolio. I didn't like hearing that at all because it's like, why? And what would, what would I do with that portfolio? I'm a big fan of it now, but you need to make sure that the portfolio works for you. So don't just put it up on a website where nobody can see it and you hope people come by it. You need to be engaging on YouTube, engaging on Twitter, engaging on LinkedIn, and actually sharing the work that you wanna do.

You know, I would say. Let's talk about 2 different personas here. So if you're a big company like open AI, yes, 100%. Because think about all the features that they've come out with. They wouldn't have known how to prioritize their product roadmap unless the open source community was demonstrating their work on the demand about how this, technology should be used in the 1st place. Alright. Now what I mean by that is Sam Alden talks about the collective intelligence. The reason why they release things on a slow basis is because they want to piecemeal their technology to see how the community reacts with it. Because you're gonna get the ethical people. You're gonna get the hackers. You're gonna get the new people. You're gonna get enterprise. You're gonna get fortune 500, all pushing on this technology. And you wanna make sure that you do it in the right way. So I'm a really big fan of open source community. And when I say that, I just mean people building in public and sharing their work. So I'm a really big fan of people doing that and people sharing because that helps our collective intelligence grow in the 1st

Bye. Awesome. Thank you very much for the time today.

And isn't it weird how you can give someone else advice and if you looked at someone else and they had your situation, you'd be like, it's a no brainer on what you should do. You need to do x, y, and z. But when it's your own situation, you get almost tunnel vision or you get, you know, almost like the fog of war, and it's really tough to have a fresh perspective. So That's why it's so good talking to people on the outside who have that fresh perspective and who can tell you with a bit more clarity on what to do.

Ken, thanks for having me, man.

Awesome. Yeah. You know, it's been a journey. I've been in and out of data for most of my career, so I'm excited to see, to talk

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good question. I would say that there's kind of 2 Pivotal pivotal moments. My 1st role out of school. So I'm a fresh fresh out of undergrad, very green in the workplace. And I started my career off in corporate FP and A. And that means I was doing finance and budgets for big corporations in their, their departments. Right? I remember getting an Excel spreadsheet. This was back before Google drive or links or anything like that. So it was just a big massive dirty un version controlled spreadsheet. And, there was a list of transactions throughout the entire page and, you know, call it something like a 100,000 transactions or whatever, more rows than I could count, more columns than I could see. And my boss was basically like, Greg, you tell us what tell us X, Y, Z. Like, I forgot what the question was, but they were like, go figure out the answer within the spreadsheet. And I found that I had a knack for digging into Excel spreadsheets and extracting an answer. Now that may sound a little silly, but if you think about most data out there, it's in tabular form. So that was planting the seeds for me to jump into data analysis, early in my career. Now that was pivotal moment number 1. Number 2 is was around 2015. I found a PDF and it was intro to data science for programmers. And In that PDF, which was basically like an old school tutorial, it taught you how to implement a recommendation system from scratch. Now nothing fancy here, But with elementary Python, implement a recommendation system. And I didn't know Python beforehand. So I was learning Python for the 1st time and what recommenders were at the at the same time. And I remember that my mind was just blown with how cool this stuff was. I was like, oh my goodness, you can extract Recommendations from simple code and simple math that wasn't confusing. And so I did all the exercises in that PDF, and that was a huge Kind of turning point in my career because I went further down the data science track after that.

Sure. So like I said, I started my career off, in finances. So I considered myself a finance person. Right? However, once I found that PDF, I Enrolled in one of the 1st data science boot camps back in 2015. So the concept of a boot camp is well known. There's web development, there's mobile, there's all that stuff. But, if from what I can tell there's this company called Zipfian and Zipfian was the 1st data science boot camp. And so there wasn't a huge data science practice at least in the professional sense. Of course there's academic and there's some very nuanced places, but not in the product growth or user analytics type of sense. And so I took that bootcamp in April 2015 and Python was the main, data analysis language in there. So I I went from a finance guy with a business background to picking up elementary Python. Now, by no means anything production grade, but I could I was I was starting to get pretty good with the Jupyter Notebook and Pandas is is my point. And, and then after that program, which was 3 months full time, 3 months full time, I landed a job at Salesforce, which, I mean, to say it changed my to say that program changed my career is an understatement because not only was I getting paid, more than double what I was getting paid in finance, I was all of a sudden I was working in Salesforce and all the access to all the amazing people within that group. And then the Salesforce name helped me out. And then not only that, but then learning on the job and just surrounding myself with product analytics, was just a huge turning point for me.

Yeah. No. Absolutely. And And funny story about fantasy sports too because I'm as well into pretty into fantasy sports and I was just learning Python, back when I was playing Yahoo Fantasy Football before they had Transaction notifications. Right? I think this was, like, 2018. You didn't know if your teammate or your league mate made a transaction. Like, they dropped a player or picked 1 up. And so I implemented my own homegrown transaction monitor. And I thought to myself, you know, I could do this just for my league, but I'm gonna open I'm gonna do this for everybody. And so I built the app, put it on Reddit, and overnight, I think I had, like, 400 people using my app. Right? Which isn't that much in in practice. But for somebody who doesn't know how to code, putting up this app and getting all of the league data and all the transactions And sending out a ton of emails about different, different occurrences was was pretty cool and pretty exciting. But to your point, that's the beautiful thing is Once you learn a little bit of code and you can start to build your own tools, that is a huge stepping stone within someone's career because then You're not limited. You're only limited by your imagination after that. So all the productivity you want, all the automations that you want are at your fingertips once you learn, this skill set. And And it's interesting to think with the AI trend, and we'll jump into this in a second here, but with the AI trend, how high is that barrier to entry for people making their own tools? Still TBD and we're gonna, we're gonna figure it out.

Sure.

Mhmm.

Yeah. That's exactly. I think the tide would rise for what value means relative value, at least because once you have an influx of a supply of tools, which is really cool, the, the, Everyone's expectations will be higher as well.

Yeah.

I think comes from, You know, I saw a quote from, Andrew Wilkinson that said something along the lines of like, a successful person is just A walking anxiety trait used for productivity or something like that. Or basically, you know, I think it's it comes from 2 things. 1 is a genuine curiosity for how things work. But then, 2, I grew up in Silicon Valley. And with that, you have a lot of success stories that you grow around you, whether it's your friends, whether it's your, whether it's your friends' parents. And so I think that the, The crap, not the crowd, but the kind of the atmosphere that I grew up in as well has always been one where you try things and you're building things and you're sharing things. And And then the minute you get hooked into that world and you jump into the entrepreneurial social media type of space, the number one thing people say you wanna build in public. You wanna build anything. You just wanna ship it out. So I think that it was early on just growing up in the Bay and then eventually just started to snowball and go from there. Now, It may look cool from the outside too. And I think I have a lot of small kind of mini hobby projects that have gone well, and I'm looking for, like, Bigger projects that will be career defining as well. But I tell you what, it's a big long journey and we're having fun along the way.

Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what, I think it's pretty well agreed upon that you wanna find what you're passionate about, you wanna build on top of that, and you wanna be able to turn your energy into a job. Right? Everyone knows it. It's a clear roadmap. Yes. However, I found that one of the hardest things in my own life is to identify what I have energy for AKA like, what's your passion and what like, even passion is kind of a hype word right now in the, in the 1st place. But finding something you have energy for Is extremely underrated because I think Paul Graham said it. It's like, get users first. We can worry about how to monetize later. There's a 1000000 ways to monetize. It's kind of like when you're thinking about projects and careers and things you want to work on, it's find whatever it is you have energy for. Don't worry. We'll be able to monetize it later. And, the other the other thing I like to say is, knowing how to do something is pretty straightforward because there's a lot of playbooks out there. There's a lot of experts. There's a lot of advice knowing what to do and what you're excited about. That's the really hard part that folks usually have a hard time for. And even even back even going further, you know, sometimes people would say, Greg, I wanna start a blog. Right? And I say, yeah. Sounds good. No problem. Just know that blog post number 3 or 4 or 5, isn't gonna be the hard part. Blog post 50, 55, 60, 70, that's when it starts to get hard because it's easy to have a spurt of energy for something. But once you need to grind and you have an you need to have endurance, that's a whole different ballpark.

Mhmm.

Mhmm.

Do you do you think you honed in on that feeling after you found success as a creator? Or do you think that you had that feeling even early on before any of the view counts, any of the audience was there?

Mhmm.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So I entered in at Salesforce as a senior analyst on what was called then the product data science team. Now that's just a fancy way of saying, basically, a growth analyst on the product analytics team, and we would partner with different products in Salesforce. So So we were like an internal consulting firm. And the way that we would grow is that we would provide value to our, our partners. So I was partnered with sales and service cloud. And if we did a good job for sales and service cloud, we could make the justification, hey. We are doing 1 1 headcount's worth of value right now. If you want us to do more because there's always more. There's always PMs. There's always features and everything. Fund our team with more headcount and we can do more for you. And that was kinda how we grew as an internal consulting firm. And When I first joined, like I said, I was a senior analyst. And, usually, data people, they have a choice to make when they get further in their career. They can go deeper down the technical route Or they can go towards the man managerial route, which can still be technical, but not nearly as much. And because of my business background, I chose to go down the managerial track. And so then I started to move into the manager position where I was managing analysts, but then also data engineers, data scientists, some visualization people and some strategy people. And, I left Salesforce on on the same team, still on the strategy and growth team. But as I was leaving Salesforce and this was to go, kind of take a personal sabbatical. So that was my, impetus for coming out. And I tried or even backing up from there. I asked the question, hey, if I'm if I'm about to leave corporate, what do I want my last 60 days to look like? Right? Who do I wanna talk to? What benefits do I wanna take advantage of right now? Or, like, how do I just wanna optimize this time? Because once you leave and your email's closed off, You're out of the club. You're you're not you're not with them anymore. Right? So I set up a bunch of 1 on ones with a whole bunch of people, a lot of people that I respected, It's kind of say my, my goodbyes. And, one of my mentors there, I won't say who, I was having my closing 1 on 1 with her and she said, Hey, Greg, I think that you should shoot to be more than the data person. And I was kind of taken aback. I was kind of taken back by that statement and I I I said, what do you mean? Why? She goes, well, data the data that you're doing right now, you're advising the decision maker. You're not the decision maker on these things. And I thought to myself, man, yeah, that's true because I would advise finance on the recommendation on what action I think they should do or the action I think marketing should do or the GM or the product people. And as always my advice or recommendation, it was not I was never the one actually making the proper decision. And so from that point in my career, I thought to myself, okay. I need to kind of steer myself more Away from that position, because it wasn't necessarily one I wanted to go deeper down and something more towards on the decision making side. And, This is always another huge question which we could have an entire podcast on is when you're a data analyst, what are the career options in front of you, and what are the different routes that you can go and explore? And so I asked myself that question many times, and the route that I found myself naturally drawn to was an operations track. So heading towards the COO realm. And if you think about why it's like, well, COO, they see internal processes and they need to speed them up. They need to make them efficient. Right? They see a lot of data. Sometimes product rolls into finance, I mean, into the COO. Sometimes finance rolls into there. And there's a lot of numbers. There's a lot of efficiencies and there's a lot of making sure that tools and orchestration is working internally within a company. And so After I left Salesforce and I was looking for my next job, I knew I wanted to go to the startup route. And so I joined Digits as their 1st business hire, which is a Fintech company. And I told the founders from on for early on, it's like, hey, here's what I did at Salesforce. Here's what I'm gonna crush for you in the beginning. I have no doubt about that, but I'm gonna steer my career in this direction. And this is the position I wanna grow into, which is much more on the operation side. And the founders were down for that. So I ended up being a good fit for me.

You know, it was, I was in a grind at Salesforce too, and it had nothing to do with Salesforce as the company per se, but it was Just it was it was a corporate environment. And I saw that my learning curve, what the next call it 5 or 6 years looked like in that single role, in that single position, wasn't exactly what I wanted to continue on doing. Now I had a few options in my in in front of me. I could go try to find another position within Salesforce, Or I could take some time off and kind of live the romantic life of going and traveling and going from there. But I chose the latter with my then girlfriend, now wife at the time, we ended up going and living in Bali for a little bit. And I worked on a bunch of projects, basically, from what we were talking about earlier. The the last thing that I'll say too is just general advice or tip that I learned Is there was a period of time at Salesforce when my immediate manager, went to another position. So I was reporting into my manager's manager. Right? And at the when I first started there, I thought to myself, man, this is gonna be really cool. I'm gonna get really awesome exposure to who has been the SVP. Right? However, the type of management that SVPs do is not the type of management that I needed in my position. They're very strategic, very, you know, long term thinking. And at that point in my career, I needed a bit more day to day types of help. And so, it ended up not being a great situation for me and it added a bit more friction to it. So that was another reason why, the impetus to leave as well.

Mhmm.

Yeah. And I was gonna say that I was gonna say the thing that just to tack onto that is We talk about expected value of it too. That's the other side of the coin. The expected value of me becoming a decision maker at Salesforce is pretty high if you just follow down the track. Right? What What you're talking about with the startup problem, yes, you can become a decision maker quicker, but your expected value of Success is so much lower that it's a it's a complete different side of the coin.

Mhmm.

you

Yeah. That's exactly it. And in fact, I got my startup job via a cold email to the founder, which is like a 4 line cold email, which, you know, the other big lesson within my career that I've seen is around storytelling. Right? And it's amazing the power of storytelling and copywriting and what it can do for you. So, you're right when a with a current you're right when you say that the name of Salesforce also helped me out a ton.

Yeah. So I was leaning back on the Salesforce name, And I'll tell you I'll tell you right now because this is a this is a good one. Yeah. So I emailed, one of the founders and I said, founder, my My name is Greg, and I was previously director of strategy and growth at Salesforce leading our sales and service analytics teams. Congratulate congratulations on the recent funding for digits. I want to help accelerate your growth. Do you mind if I send you my resume and bullet points to see if it's a good fit? And so the reason Nice.

Just nice and short. The resume, sure, because that's just standard. But then I said, do you want me to put bullet points? Because no exec wants to read a resume. I mean, really, they want the TLDR. And so I and then he didn't even respond to the first one. I had to follow-up with him again. And he was like, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's let's see what let's basically see what you got. And so I sent it over to him, and that started

Yeah. Accenture. It's basically. Right.

Yeah. Right after I left Zipfian, I did a video about my job searching process and how I landed at Salesforce. And the number 1 lesson throughout that entire thing is Don't apply through the front door. Careers.uber.comcareers.lift.com. That's you're sending your resume into an abyss there. I put all of my energy into cold emails to recruiters and hiring managers. I got more responses and more hit rates from that, than 200 applications into random career pages. It it's just that it's just not the way it works. Oh, yeah. Same goes for LinkedIn. Don't apply on LinkedIn. It just does not does not work at all.

that for sure. Yeah.

Sure.

mean, the that type of job hunting is just like a sales funnel. And coming from a growth background, if you break it down just like a funnel, You can see exactly where your problems are. So if somebody tells me they have a hard time getting a job, I just start at the top of the funnel. I say, how's your outbound? What do you mean? What's what do you mean what outbound? Alright. Well, there you go. There's the problem. You know? And then it's like, okay, what's your response rate on your outbound? Oh, you know, it's 1%. Okay. Well, I think that could be a little bit higher. And you just go down. It's, like, how many phone calls have you had with a recruiter? How many have you had with a hiring manager? How many have, you know, 2nd round, you know, blah, blah, blah. And then you can really just diagnose where the problem is. And I would say that most folks, they have a volume problem at the top of the funnel. They're not doing enough outbound. And then it's also a conversion problem on that outbound so their sales pitch or their email or their online persona is not curated enough that recruiters are rejecting them, before they even reply.

Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And on that point where you said people fall back on what's easy for them. I'm I was on the My First Million podcast, Sam Parr said a line that was just that hit me a lot. He goes, people or looking for excuses as to why something didn't work out for them or something like that. I don't know what it is. They're looking for permission to not put an energy into something. And so if you only do what's easy for you and you don't do what's hard or what's differentiated, you're not gonna end up getting what you want in the 1st place.

Mhmm.

small return. And isn't it weird how You can give someone else advice and if you looked at someone else and they had your situation you'd be like, it's a no brainer on what you should do. You need to do x, y, and z. But when it's your own situation, you get almost tunnel vision or you get, you know, almost like the fog of war. And it's really tough to have a fresh perspective. So That's why it's so good talking to people on the outside who have that fresh perspective and who can tell you, with a bit more clarity on what to do.

Yeah.

Sure.

something like that.

Mhmm.

Yeah. So back at digits, Like I said, I moved my career over to the operations track. And what that entailed was figuring out many automations, like, in work. Right? So how do you hook up Zapier to do this? How do you get the analytics engine to start working or whatever? And you combine that with my Python skill set that I learned early on my career. Building tools is just fun. Right? It's just so cool to build something and then see it work for you. Right? And so that was baked into me. And I had an I had an earlier experience teaching people how to do data analysis on, YouTube. So I think it was 2 or 3 years ago, I started a YouTube channel called Data Independent and I just made Pandas tutorials. Right? So what I did was I had a lit the top 60 Pandas functions by Google search. How, like the, volume of search, per per month, checking HRFs or SEM rush or whatever. And I just started at the top And I went all the way down and I just did a blog post, a video, a code sample, well, those 3 for each one of those different, functions. And there's 60 of them so I pounded 1 out per day for 2 months and I was trying to do the SEO play. Right? I put it on autopilot for, like, 2 years. SEO went up. It was great. Couple sponsors, not bad. Flash forward to January of this year, January 2023, and I see on Hacker News The launch post for Langchain. And I've later talked to Harrison, told him that was very influential for me. He goes, We didn't even post that. Somebody else posted that. Alright. Whatever. But either way, I saw it in January because the 1st PR for Langchain was in October of 22. And when I saw that, As you know, hacker news can be kind of, grumpy sometimes with new technologies and they kind of rag on new technologies. And The comment section was like really into Linkedin and I was like, I still have no idea what this thing is. I go to the documentation. It's tough to figure it out. I'm not so sure. I look on YouTube, there's no tutorials on LinkedIn. And I thought to myself, oh my goodness, this is so cool. Right? And I had tried experimenting with the OpenAI API itself, and I was running into all the problems that Langchain had solved. So, the problem of chunking, The problem of connecting to other data sources, the, you know, just x, y, z, all that stuff. And I thought to myself, man, this framework is really, really cool. And I wanna learn how to do it. And so I think one of my first either tweets or videos was I'm going on a journey to learn how to build really cool, impactful AI applications. Come along with me on this journey, if you want to, Learn with me, basically. And so I ended up doing a whole bunch of content for it. And, it's been a really fun journey since then. Now Connecting it back to what we talked about earlier in the podcast, sharing in public. I never really considered myself a content person, right? Until this year. And It's been it's been unreal. It's been surreal. I mean, the amount of inbound opportunities has been awesome. The amount of meeting cool people who are interested in the AI space has just been really cool And I'm just so thankful for, the opportunities that have been presented and it, and I'm, I'm, I'm not stopping. Like it's, it's just been way too fun. So now, as long as I can sustain myself financially with this journey, we're gonna keep on doing good stuff.

I was gonna say, I tell you what, I think part of the reason why That's the case is because, you know, I told you my background earlier. I'm not technical by trade. Right? I'm not a software engineer. And I tell people all the time, I'm not gonna be your production grade engineer to get you to, you know, 99.99 uptime. Right? My background and my passion is in b two b products and delivering value to customers. So if I'm gonna teach a technical topic, I need it to be dead simple. Like, I need it to speak like English. So some of my code you'll see it right to is not the most optimized. It's gonna be slow, But it's gonna be so simple that you can understand and kinda read it like a book because if I don't have it that simple, then I don't understand it either. So I think that That's another, differentiator that people resonate with with content wise.

Yeah. And every creator too, they have a choice about what type of audience member do they wanna serve. And so I've strategically Not gone to the here's how you install Anaconda. Here's how you install Python. I I let other creators and other people do that stuff. It's once you open a Jupyter Notebook, Let's go. Game on. We're gonna have some fun and and go from there.

Sure. So let me do it at a few different levels of abstraction. Z. Lang, let me put this. Langchain is to what what pandas is to doing data analysis. Langchain is to helping build AI applications. Cool. What is what is Langchain? Langchain is a series of abstractions packaged up in a Python library that makes working with language models easy to do. Right? What is Langchain? Langchain is an easy way to develop AI applications. So what it what it means in I mean, in English here is basically, a lot of the hard parts that you'll run into if you just interact with the OpenAI API, It like the raw one itself or any other language model API, you're gonna quickly run into a series of problems. First one is gonna be context limit. You're gonna try to put in a 50 page book into a prompt. And you're gonna get an error back from the API that says, hey, you tried doing too much here.

So yeah. So what do you do? Oh, well, I'm gonna split up my document and I'm gonna make a 4 loop and then I'm gonna chunk it and then I'm gonna try to put it in piece by piece. Well, instead of you doing that yourself with vanilla Python, there's libraries that are specialized in this and Langchain is one of those. Now Langchain is open source. That means that you can go and check out the code on GitHub yourself. I frequently need to go into their source code and go check out different parameters or whatever whatever it may be. Lang chain was one of the first frameworks out there, and it's Super interesting to see some of the lang chain decisions get permeate per per permeate throughout the industry. So The lang chain was one of the 1st groups to allow you to connect external data sources to a language model. Right? And I don't know how many months Head start they had on it, but then all of a sudden OpenAI has plugins come around and they mentioned Langchain in the plugin blog post launch blog post. Super, super interesting. Right? So Langchain is an what is Langchain? Langchain is an awesome community of builders that is in the forefront of building with AI. And because it's open sourced, you get a lot of really cool integrations and a lot of really cool abstractions that are on the tip of the spear for building language models.

Mhmm.

Totally. Yeah. Absolutely. And I like, I like dissecting. Like like why did line chain rise so quickly to the top? Right? I think, I mean, this may be a bit of an overstatement, but, like, the vibe on Twitter with people sharing their projects It is absolutely massive. And not only that, Langchain isn't some, like, project in the background where it's like some back end service that doesn't make any sense to anybody. You can show your line chain project to your grandmother. Right? You can show it to your mom. You can show it to your brother or whoever it may be. And It's gonna it could potentially immediately provide value to that person. So I think that line chain rose so quickly because People were making impactful demos. That's it. Impactful demos on Twitter that shared really well and went viral extremely quickly. So, like, There was a time when it was, novel and extremely cool to connect a PDF to chat gpt. Right? Like, today, it's like, oh, no big deal. Everybody and their mother's doing that. But there's a time when that was a really big deal. Right? People did that for all the different domains and all the different niches. And so all of a sudden, software engineers from finance, from auto, from health care, from aviation, from everywhere are Wondering, how do I do this for my own data? And so they jumped on the trend and LaneChain was the one that did it for him. There's a lot of other libraries out there that help connect data like LAMA index. And, and it's just it's super interesting to see how this industry is evolving both in the open source and the closed source side.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the reason why they went to a 100,000,000 so quickly.

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so Let let's just let's just talk about a few big buckets here. So one of the big buckets that I personally like, I'm not sure why, but is around transcripts and spoken word. Right? So I made a project where I would analyze sales calls with a language model, and I would extract information that was relevant to the salesperson. What are the next steps? What are the follow ups? What are the pain points of the customer? Right? Etcetera, etcetera. Huge, massive there. I'm knee deep in podcast work right now as well. So doing topic extraction from podcasts. And so one of my partners, they have 400 podcasts on that on their on their series there. And And there's a bunch of business ideas and life advice and product recommendations and quotes that are just sitting on that podcast in unstructured form and they're not taking advantage of it. Right? And so to be able to extract that information and get it ready for the content engine, so go and make shorts, go and make, you know, ads or whatever it may be. I mean, clear clear use case extracting that stuff. Another huge one that I love personally is around idea generation. So if I have a goal and I wanna do something, the language model has no doesn't have my internal bias when I'm, trying to figure out ways that I can do something. Right? So I often tell the model, hey. Can you give me 10 ideas to complete this goal? And 8 of them are no good. I mean, they're gibberish. Right? One of them isn't bad, but the last one really inspires some energy in me to go and do something. Right? And then all of a sudden I get, like, little butterflies and I Oh, yeah. This is such a cool idea. I wanna go ahead and do this one. Really, really powerful there. But then the the part that I've saved for last here is is where everybody's talking about it is truly on the decision making side. So on the using a language model as a reasoning engine, which still Blows my mind that that's the case. So we saw the early demos of like an auto GPT or a baby AGI which blew everybody away, But then there's a little bit of mismanaged expectations because they're not as valuable as they may want them to be in its current state today. I have no doubt that they will be eventually. It's really cool to see the browser automation work that's happening with companies like MultiOn and with companies like Adept. Though I'm I'm still waiting. I would love to see what Adept is up to recently because I haven't heard much from them. So I think browser automation is a huge huge one. And then The other piece that gets me really excited is around thinking about how big companies like Salesforce, Intuit, enter Amazon, You know, Microsoft, Google's, how are they gonna use language models internally? And what does their own internal plug in architecture look like? Right? And who's managing those internal plug ins? And is that a new class of developer? Because that's kind of like what, I forget the the the fellow's name. But he put out that blog post around the AI engineer. That's the new job title that's gonna be coming around. Those people are gonna be managing internal plugins for b to b operations as as well, which I think is gonna be super, super cool. But then not only that, the last thing I'll say here is I started noticing on Twitter that a lot of people were forcing chat gpt for interesting use cases. So people on Twitter would say, oh, I use chat gpt for therapy or I use it to generate bedtime stories for my kid or I use it for argument formation, like, I'm about to present something to my boss and I wanna know what questions he may have so I can better my argument or whatever. And so I collected all those ideas and And I have a Notion doc of, like, a 100 different ideas of people using chat TBD for super interesting use cases out in the wild. And Right now I think the limit for doing more is really around reliability because these things aren't as deterministic as we need, and People's imagination with it too. The last thing I'll finish up with is I don't think that The limiting factor on more tech progress with LLMs is GPT four's reasoning ability. I think that It is fine for right now, but we are extremely immature on the superstructures that interact with GPT four and that there's a lot of room to go there. So even if GPT Ford stayed at the exact same reasoning ability that it is today, You give us another 5 years. The world is completely different. Even with GPT four, we don't need GPT 5678 quite yet.

Yeah. Well, I tell you what, I'm making the script I'm making the script right now. The the biggest pain in the butt with this entire thing is just data processing, getting the files, making sure they're organized, and setting up the structure itself. Then language model part is the easy part. So, let's chat later and we'll we'll try it out.

Nice. Well, let's take those 3 just 1 by 1 there. If you wanna get started with Langchain, I made I literally made 2 2 videos to Answer that exact question. So video number 1 is just the Langchain 7 core use cases. Now that is just I'm sorry. I think 7 core concepts. That one is just like the 7 ways that people are interacting with language models. It's the 7 abstractions that you're gonna wanna know the most. I would watch that first. There's a corresponding code notebook that's open source. You can go grab it. Run it all on your own. The 2nd video is the line chain 9 use cases. So you learn the nuts and bolts, but then what do you do with them? Well, you do summarizing. You do question and answering. You do extraction and tagging and all that, etcetera, etcetera. Go watch that next. After those 2 videos, you're gonna be very well prepared with the nuts and bolts to go make your own project, which is really step 3. Go pick something that interests you, Go connect one of your own documents. Go build a question and answer bot and go have some fun and then put it on Twitter and share publicly. Right? That's That's the way I would recommend that people get started with LinkedIn. Now, the 2nd question around how do you become more on the decision maker side of the house? It's really being intentional about your career. Because if you're not in the decision making standpoint right now and you want to be, well, that means that you're gonna have to make a shift in your career. And the best way that you can do that is through intentionality. And looking at people who are a few years ahead of you and figuring out Who do I wanna be like? And whose career do I wanna go and model after and figure out how to get from a to b? And if you're like, well, I really don't know where to start. It may be trite but go ask chat g p t. This is my current career. This is where I wanna go. What are 10 ways that I can go and do it? And like I said 8 of those ways are gonna be bogus but 2 of them are gonna maybe get you excited and make you, start to go do it.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's exactly it. And then lastly, if you wanna get a hold of me, my Put our DMs are open. That's where I respond to a whole bunch of people. That's a great spot. If not, you can go on my regular website, which is contact at dataindependent.com. Or lastly, throw up a YouTube comment, but I don't respond to all of them depending on the question from there. But either way, I love talking to folks. And, If somebody gives me a well formulated question, I generally respond. If you throw me your Python bug in a YouTube comment, and you say, why isn't this working? I generally won't respond.

Awesome, Ken. Thank you very much, man.

Kamrad. Kamrad.

Mhmm.

We'll get there.

Awesome. Thank you very much for having me, and I'm excited to dive into it today.

Yeah. There's 0 signs. Well, maybe you could talk to my parents then. There might have been something there. No. I mean, it's, no. No early signs there. I I can't say that I have an origin story. It all kinda started when I had my 1st job out of school. I was doing corporate FP and A, and what that means is that you're doing big budgets for other companies. Right? And so the very first instance that I knew that I was a spreadsheet minded kind of data nerd was they would give you a list of transactions, and then this just looked like absolute gibberish When I first saw it, and it was a bunch of rows, bunch of, you know, bunch of columns, had no idea how to get into it. And they said, Greg, go extract an insight from this data. And so all of a sudden, it was me needing to dive into the spreadsheet and go pull out a story. Because once you have the numbers, well, then you gotta go present them to people too. And so, I found that I weirdly enjoyed that. I turned into an Excel monkey, and I was using the keyboard, no mouse. And I could really kinda just Feel the spreadsheet and go get good stuff from it. So I would say that was the 1st instance when I knew that, hey, Greg. You should probably lean into this a little bit more.

Yeah. You know? So I guess my first four 4 way 4 way into it was, back in o nine, actually. And I didn't I did tutorials on YouTube, but it wasn't for what you'd think it'd be. It was, it was Photoshop tutorials. Wow. So for some because back then, we're talking old school Photoshop o nine. And photo editing kinda just, like, blew my mind because you had this thing that you think looks static, but then all of a sudden you can apply your creativity and switch the colors and do all this other fun stuff to it. And it was back when photo editing was still hard. So I would teach people how to go do some of the stuff, and I threw it on YouTube. No face, No name. No personal brand. No nothing. I had no idea what I was doing. So those are my first videos, back back in 09. I was And I know I'll date myself a little bit here, but I was 19 at that time doing my 1st videos on YouTube.

Oh, yeah. I mean, it was early days, YouTube. I mean, we're talking, like, You know, now there's much there's enough CSS to make it look nice and flowy, and it looks modern. Back then, we're still talking no rounded corners, sharp edges. Like Right. The old school Myspace looking type of YouTube versus, what we have today.

You know, I would say it, introduced me to the topic, which I thought was cool. Right? But I was doing random videos. I did Videos of my stepbrother. I did Photoshop tutorials. I did, like, stop motion animation videos, kind of scrolling everything that's up there. Yeah. I took a stop motion class at, at college, which was really fun. But what really convinced me to, like, double down on it and, like, go hard on it Was, during COVID at the beginning of COVID, I was reading I was just reading a bunch of business books, and one of those was, the rich dad, poor dad one. And I liked half the book. The first half, I really like. The second half was kinda just way out there for me, but what they really drill into is the concept of assets. Right? And I know everybody knows this, but assets are things that you put your energy into, and they end up compounding for you, right, when you stop putting your energy into it. We usually think of it as, financial assets. You know? You go make an investment. But another huge type of asset is a content asset. So much like y'all are doing with your content right now, after we record this video, the video is gonna live on forever, and people will be able to see that and keep on viewing on it. And it's gonna do work for you while you're not working anymore. So that motivated the heck out of me. And so I started This is, like, you know, like I said, like, 2020, so beginning in COVID. I doubled down on content, but specifically for data analysis. So I was teaching people how to do pandas, Which is a popular Python library. And the way that I did it is I took the 60 most popular pandas functions by SEO strength. And so the most Googled Uh-huh. To the least Googled. And, really, I didn't like anybody's content out there because there was either, Like, automated content, which wasn't very good. This was before LLMs, and so it was, like, really bad content. Or there was, like, kinda like lifeless one off tutorials that really weren't really done at scale. So I said, you know, I'm gonna do this different, and I'm gonna go for the high quality play. So I did a video. I did a Jupyter Notebook, and I did a blog post for every single one of those 60, which took 2 months because I did 1 per day. And so that's when I kinda, like, got really into it. And then I'll skip forward to the the front part, but then, late last year, You know, g Chativity is coming out. AI is getting huge. And I looked, and there was a lack of content and educating people how to do this type of material on, especially YouTube. And I kinda just it hit me. I was like, dude, you gotta redo what you did for pandas, but you gotta do it for this. Right. Because this it almost felt like my pandas work. At the time, it felt like it was like, the, the the ends. Like, oh, I just did that. It's just sitting over there, whatever. But looking back in it, it's almost like that trained me to really, really take advantage of this opportunity now and to connect with a whole lot of people. So when I started doing this AI stuff, It wasn't from scratch, and so I learned some things along the way, and I I think that helped me out a little bit.

Yeah.

tutorials. Right?

Yeah. So the reason why those came around is I went to Layla Marymount down in Los Angeles, California. And, it's a very expensive school. And after I got down with freshman year, my dad told me he pulled me to the side. He said, hey, Greg. You can't pay for your other 3 years like you paid for freshman year. You're gonna be way too in debt because I pulled out a fat student loan freshman year, I'm an 18 year old guy. I I mean, not 18 year old guy, but 18 year old kid. I have no idea what money means. Right? Especially in the in the tens of 1,000 of dollars that we're talking about for student loans. And so I looked at my options in sophomore year. I went to community college. And what's wild is that community college, The same year that cost me tens of 1,000 of dollars at LMU was $700 for the entire year at community college. Yeah. Credits transferred. Everything was just fine, which is which is wild to me. But the reason why I could go back to LMU for junior and senior year It's because I joined a program that they had called the student worker program. And if it wasn't for that program, I wouldn't I've gone back to Elmview. It completely changed my college directory. And so the a trajectory. And the way that it worked was you got a full time job, And they they paid something like it was half to 3 quarters of your college tuition. But you the full time job was working on campus, so sometimes it was trash duty. Sometimes it was, you know, setting up chairs for graduation. Sometimes it was, you know, rolling around and doing odd jobs for professors and things like that. Yeah. So, I mean, it was amazing for me. Right? And not only that, but it really instilled the value of, working to earn your place at this at this university. So I didn't have the luxury of falling back and having, It being paid for through whatever through whatever means. Right. And so through financial aid, through student work, and I ended up, going back. And Junior year, I think I took out maybe, like it's either 5 or 10,000 for a student loan. And then senior year, I didn't have to take out a loan because of financial aid and because of the student worker program. So Yeah. It was a really, really big thing for me, at the time.

I I wanna go that far because I was still carrying my freshman year, like massive amount. So Right.

they give you a 6 months grace grace period after you graduate where your bank doesn't that you don't need to pay Payments. Right? Once you get on your feet. I remember that I had a high interest rate at that time. What would I thought what I thought was I, it was, like, 7 or 8%. Right? Yeah. I was like

Well, we're back there now, but, you know, as a as a kid. And I just remember my mind being blown where I'm just making up numbers. I have no idea what it actually were, but I put in $1,000 towards my student loan, And my balance only goes down $200.

And I'm like, what just happened? Anyway, so that was my lesson into interest rates, you know, way back then, which, you know, that's a whole another story too because the thing that helped me pay off my student loans was really getting a a higher paying job. Like, I know a lot of people are, like, just grind and put everything you can into it, but it wasn't until I got a higher paying job that I could really make a dent in my loans. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Exactly.

Yeah. That's exactly it.

You YouTube YouTube maybe, but e but either way, the fraternity was a hugely transformational process for me at, at LMU, I mean, it it was my life. Right? And so I joined 2nd semester freshman year, and I was through it through the rest. It was an amazing opportunity, not only because of the service that we all did too. So we did a lot of community service, but then the brotherhood with all the With all the guys that you're hanging out with and the involvement in school, it just was a very active way to participate in university. And it's not for everybody. Totally cool. It resonated well with me, and I liked it. And so what was I gonna say about oh, yeah. So, Going in it was, like, 2nd semester junior year, and there's about to be, elections for leadership positions in the fraternity. And I forget where I had this spurt or the energy, but it was one of those quotes of, like, if not you, then who? Right? And Mhmm. You know, I had another Huge spurt of motivation. And I remember sitting in a classroom with a friend and just pounding out kind of like, what is my pitch and, like, like, what is my platform and my campaign and all that, And ended up doing the the rounds because the way that you do elections is, you know, you basically give your presentation in front of everybody, and, The voting process isn't very sophisticated. It's, yeah, raise of hands. But Yeah. Anyway, I ended up getting it, and, that was my 1st leadership position. And Right. More than anything, it instilled into me the confidence that, hey, dude. If you want something, go after it. And then now because of this confidence that I had, it had me do other leader other leadership positions throughout life, Which that was the really first big stepping stone that made me believe in myself, which was which was really awesome. The other lesson that I learned while being president, Which I'll say right now, that is carried with me through life is, getting the fraternity to do anything was a big pain in the ass. Right? Mhmm. If you needed volunteers or something, if you needed, well, basically volunteers for a lot of things. And if you send out a text message to the fraternity wide channel, nobody would respond. Right? And I'm looking at the at the room while I'm having one of my chapter meetings. I'm thinking to myself, But that's so weird because if I asked anybody individually, they would say, yes. Of course. Dude, Greg, I got you. No problem. So at that moment, I realized, if you want to get support with somebody, you really need the connection with them, and you should really reach out 1 on 1 Because then they're gonna do any they're they'll do anything you need for them. But doing a mass email or a mass text message, it's a recipe for disaster.

Yeah. Exactly.

Yeah. So I You gotta put my, if I put myself in my shoes back then. Right? I was working in a cubicle. I know it's like it's like funny, but, like, this fully foreign these days. But I was working in a cubicle, and I was doing finance. And Living in the bay, I it was also in the South Bay. So for those with the Bay Area geography, San Francisco's you know, there's a lot going on there. Old school Silicon Valley is gonna be down on the South Bay, and that's where this company was. And so I'm doing finance. It feels like the world is kinda passing me by because I'm hearing all this tech movement. All and I I have nothing to do with product, nothing to do with eng, nothing to do with Building new things, investors of the progress forward. You know? I'm I'm doing budgets. No no hate for anybody doing budgets. Just me as year old, it was not vibing with me well. I'd over my my my clothes are too big. I didn't know how to dress. I had to wear tucked in shirts every day, you know, that type of thing. And so more More than anything, it was just a restlessness to wanna get out. And so I went and traveled, basically. I, I Left, I think, probably, is about 6 months or 7 months or 8 months or something like that. Backpacked Europe. I worked at a hostel in Italy, which is where I got some hospitality experience, which is crazy. It was one of those live work exchanges where they don't pay you, but you can stay there for free and you can eat for free, which is a good deal. Yeah. I mean, I was fabulous. And then I came back to the States, and I had this realization where it's like, Dude, you can't just go land back in San Francisco because then it's like you left and nothing changed, and nothing were was to show of this big, you know, kind of Chapter change that you had in your life. And so I, found myself in DC. And when I was in DC, I started to in inch my way into Python. So at this point, I only knew Excel. But still to this day, And I very, very thoroughly believe that if you know Excel, you can learn to code Python. It is it's not the same, but If you think about Excel, you're working with tabular data. You're working with rows. You're working with columns Yeah. Fields. You're working with if statements. I mean, you're not that far off from doing Python. Yeah. And so I I was doing that, and then, I found a PDF, and I think it was called data mining for Programmers or data mining for practitioners or something? I can share it afterwards for for show notes, but I read that. And the author Made the topic of data science so approachable. Mhmm. It would it blew my mind. And one of the first exercises was to implement A recommendation system. So not only talk about what it is, but then implement it. And it was like, wow. So a recommendation system is only measuring the between users and the ratings that they have on, on, you know, songs or whatever, and then seeing who which user you're you're most similar to and then Recommending something from their library? Yep. That's cool. And so I got inundated on, this idea. And then It but this was just me messing around in my studio. Right? Right.

I take it to the next level? This was back this was back in 2015, And it was when, boot camps were big, but Right. Web boot web boot camps were big, and mobile boot camps were big. Mhmm. There was no data science boot camps. There was 1, and it was called Zipfian Academy. And they had just started, but I I looked at their website, And it said, of our graduates, 95% get a job within 6 months, and your Average out of job salary is double what I was making at corporate finance. So I was like Good stats. I like this. It's a technical skill, which I know is in high demand. I'm probably gonna get a job, and my job is probably gonna pay me double. Yeah. Sure. I'll go and do this. So I applied, and I took an interview. I have no idea why they ended up taking me. There was 1 section on the stats that I just completely bombed with, Poisson distributions and things like that. It was wild. So I did that. Anyway, ended up getting in. I got my student loans delayed for another 3 months because the the third party lender, Wells Fargo, actually was very generous, and they it was a it was an out of or it was an Uncommon request that I say, hey. Can you stop this? For this this time, because it's another schooling. I'm trying to better myself, etcetera. They were down for it. They stopped it. I took the program. I went heads down for three and a half months, like, 12 hours a day. That's where I picked up Python, picked up pandas. It hit the job market hard and ended up getting a job at Salesforce. That really changed I mean, that changed Changed my entire career. Not only was my career identity different, but I was getting paid more. And I was now in San Francisco in the tech scene, so it it totally changed it for me.

Believe me, man. Like, I was in my, I was in my DC studio apartment and, like, really, like, down on myself. Just thinking like, what the heck am I doing? Where am I going? What's the path in life? Where you know, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And the thing that kept the thing that initially turned me on to that, that PDF was I was just tinkering around with stuff. Like Yeah. I was just trying to tinker with data, tinker with a little bit of Python. Like, I had no idea what I'm doing. You know? And, Yeah. And, anyway, so the tinkering got me. It was a good stepping stone to getting forward.

Yeah. Totally. Yeah. So back in 2015, that was when the article was coming around that somebody had wrote that was like, oh, data science is gonna be the sexiest job of the 21st century. Remember that whole phase? That was a little while ago. Right? Yeah. It's just it's wild because nobody would say that now. They'd say, you know, like, an ML engineer or something like that. But Right. So that was going on. So At Salesforce, that was a corporate data environment, right, which is completely different than a start up data environment. There's pros and cons to both. Back then, data science was well, there's kinda 2 routes. I mean, it's kinda even the same now. I mean, you have your really, really deep ML, like research academic side, and then you have your more practitioner application. Let's use algorithms to go go do cool things. And that is the that's the route that's the route that I end up going. So I was a person who would use classification algorithms, who would do time series forecasting, who would do regressions and things That to go do product analytics at Salesforce. And so I stepped into this role unbeknownst to me really because I was I was still figuring it out. It was it was a growth rule, Which is a Venn diagram of good data skills, but then also the application side and doing it within product analytics, but then Also trying to storytell to your stakeholders, like, what the heck your recommendation is to go do. Right. So Anyway, so data science back then was kinda like vanilla random forests. Like, that's the easiest way I can like, go spin a scikit learn. Go open up a Jupyter Notebook. Go do a, train test split, and go mess around, and go tune some hyperparameters, and go do grid search to try to find the best ones and, you know, all that other stuff. And that was also when you did did it on with your local datasets. It's like you could load up a lot of datasets within your own Jupyter Notebook. It was no big deal. Now, I mean, The tools are just so much more advanced, and it almost seems like people are moving past the vanilla classification algorithms where if you're using random force, that's almost like You do it because it's only 2 lines of code, and you just wanna try it out. Yeah. You people are moving on to more sophisticated types of things, and, And I I won't I won't speculate about where it's going, but with the AI stuff, there's just a lot more question marks around what types of skills Should you invest in right now, if you wanted to, you know, leverage your energy as much as possible?

You know, I, It's starting like, the whole, like, oh, maybe I'll get replaced. It's like, yeah, one day for sure, But I like to leave those for, like, kinda, like, philosophical conversations around the fireplace

That type of thing. Like, today, like, Actual. Like, if I'm a college student just about to graduate, what am I doing today? I'm still learning the fundamentals. I mean, I guess if we're talking about data science, still learning the fundamentals of data science. Until there's a tool that comes out there that There there's always gonna be tools that you need to learn to uplevel in your job. Right? If you're worried about getting replaced, that's a rough place to be in. The advice I would give to you is Stay at the forefront of what's coming out for your specific industry. Yeah. If you do get replaced, it's not gonna happen overnight. It's not gonna be like, hey. Monday morning, you don't have a job anymore. It's gonna be a slow transition. And like any competitive professional, and when I say competitive, I just mean somebody who's active in learning in their in their career, You're gonna have to learn the tools. People had to learn computers. They had to learn the Internet. They learned SAS. You know? Anybody who didn't learn the SAS SAS software, or they were anti that. Well, they didn't get by very long, and they're definitely not having fun right now. So, So I'm not worried about anybody getting replaced right now. I think there's ample opportunity for you to upload their skills all over the place.

Yeah. Yeah. I totally agree. And the other thing too that I think people overlook is A single job function is not a single workflow. Right?

Like, even if we were just take a small example, data scientists, where do they get the requirements from? Well, it's usually a stakeholder that they have that tells them what is a priority for the business and what they need to go do. Okay. So is a stakeholder gonna input a prompt and get to get an answer out? No. So the human is also a huge storyteller and interpreter that comes with it. So I think the most likely example is that data scientists, yes, they'll still have their jobs. Some of their mini workflows will get a little speed boost. Right? Just like, DBT comes out and helps people through the ETL process, and it there's a lot of really cool things with it. A lot of people are learning DBT, and now they're speeding up and they're going faster and things like that. So I think the same thing will happen with AI. Like, Hey. Can you go do exploratory data analysis for me? Go give me some good stuff back. Okay. Cool. Now I'm gonna double click myself and do manually, You know, go dive deeper into a section here, but, no one's getting their job replaced overnight.

Yeah. Absolutely. So I actually left my position at Digits. This was in January of this year, so January 2023. And since then, I've I've been on my own, and a major portion of that has been doing, content for the AI space. Now what has been surprising to me is the amount of reaction had come from it. And I think it was a it was a lot of right place, right time, and that's totally that's I mean, I see I see that's totally cool. I think a little bit of it too was that I found a way to try to position content that I think has a little bit of reaction that comes from the from the audience, which is awesome. And so now there's a big open question, which is, hey. When you have YouTube subscriber growth in a little bit, not much, but just a little bit, and you have a little bit of, Twitter growth, What are the routes in front of you to go have some fun? Right? And so the way that I'm answering that question for myself is you have to think about your personal goals, not even career. Like, what kind of life do you want for your family? What life do you wanna live? What how do you wanna grow? Just all those other stuff. You start with what's important to you and your values. And then from there, You back out a plan just like anything else at work. I mean, it's not rocket science. Right? And so, I've done that with myself, and I backed it out. And As of right now, I'm having a lot of fun and getting a lot of good ROI on the content side. And the content side is kind of a it's kind of a trite word that's overused, but, really, I like making cool projects, and I like sharing them with people. And it it it's been fun. Right? And so I think that the piece that I'm leaning into right now Is that though I've gotten popular over tutorials thus far, I don't necessarily wanna keep on doing tutorials. Right? There could be 1 route where I wanna go, do a school type of environment, and I, You know, teach people how to do that. But I've told you my background. At my core, I'm not a software engineer. Right? I'm a b to b products guy who really, really likes seeing product scale. I really like extracting an insight from a customer and figuring out what to build. I really like looking at a market landscape and figuring out how do we position ourselves for it. I really like data analysis. I real you know, I like a lot of other things that come with it. And so I think a school prod, maybe not quite yet, especially on the software engineering side. And then On the, company side, that is 100% in my purview for sure, but I don't wanna I don't wanna rush into it. I wanna do something that's, like, When it hits me and I the right people come into play, the right idea comes into play, then I wanna say, you know what? I'm ready to go tackle that for now. However, The content side right now, people often say how you make content and ends it ends up being a top of funnel for you. It's absolutely true because a lot of cool opportunities have come, a lot of speaking opportunities, a lot of meeting really cool people, lot lot of meeting really cool VCs, And meeting really cool sponsors too, so I'm starting to do a little bit of sponsorship content, for for for the content. But my my approach right now, like I said, I'm this is being long winded, but I said, I don't wanna be just known for tutorials. So if If I think about the intersection of business in the AI space, I think to myself, what really, really excites me right now? And the thing that just freaking fascinates me so much is Where is value gonna accrue in the AI space in business? Like, how is AI gonna help business people do more? Like, I'm not talking about Which jobs are gonna get replaced? I'm talking about today. Like, the marketing person on your team, they log in on Friday morning. What could they be doing today that's gonna help your business out? And talking to people about that, hearing those stories, It's just it's just been extremely fun. So the last thing I'll say, then I'll pass it back to y'all is I just heard about this concept of the AI committee at the workspace. Right? I had no idea what this was. I was talking to a VC. They said, yeah. We're starting our AI committee at work right now. I said, what's that? They said, oh, well, it's a group of employees That are tasked with figuring out what we should do internally to get better at AI at our workplace. I was like, oh, that's kinda interesting. And I tell my wife that, and she goes, We just got an email about that today. We have our own group doing that right now. And so this is the perfect type of problem and just such an interesting thing that I'm really fascinated by. So I sent out a tweet, and I ended up getting 12 user research interviews of people who are doing AI committees. And it's like, heck, yeah. Let's talk about this. What are you doing? What's what's not working? And so I'm putting out a video on that probably later this month, on what I learned from it. But those are the types of things that I found I found really interesting.

Yeah. I would say that the biggest one that's standing out to me even today is the amount of storytelling that happens within a corporate data team. Now if you're in academia and you're doing research and you're doing deep ML, okay, there's not a ton of storytelling that goes in there, and that's okay. You know, you're you're doing your research project. But when you're in a corporate environment and you have stakeholders and you only have so much energy that you can expend, you have to make sure that that expenditure is going to good use. Right? So, I have, I have a topic for a very long form article, potentially even longer. That's all around the empathy that an analyst needs to build before they can do good data analysis. And it's it's really 3 parts. Right? So you need stakeholder empathy, which means you need to know what their priorities are. You need to know what's important to them. You need to know where the business is going, and you need to know, what they'll react to and, like, what you need to do. Right? Mhmm. Number 2 is customer empathy. So who is your customer? What are they doing? Have you looked at the usage logs 1 by 1 to really get a feeling for what they're doing? Have you done user research interviews, and and all that. And then the last one, which maybe is I should have said first because it's Carl Lane, but It's product empathy. So do you know your product inside and out? Salesforce is a very complicated product. Now that's just just a sales piece It's complicated. But then there's platform, and then there's mobile, and then there's the ecosystem, and then there's app exchange and all that other stuff. It gets very complicated very quickly. And if you don't have all 3 of those pieces as a data person, you're not gonna have a good time, and your impact is not gonna be as much as it as the next person who has all 3 of those things. So what I learned at Salesforce was that there is an immense amount of nondata skill that one needs to learn in order to be an effective data person, in a corporation like that.

That's exact that's exactly and so I another saying I have is, like, Analysis does no good if it just stays on your local computer. Right. Mhmm. Right? It's like even if you came up with the most groundbreaking freaking money making thing analysis. Right? How you infect the org with that insight is also a skill that is, that is hard to do.

Yeah. You're you're you're absolutely right. And You're hinting at something that doesn't get talked about a ton, but you're, I think information asymmetry is a great way to put it because the data person is Extremely intimate with the data, knows how dirty it is, know all knows all the exceptions and everything. An interesting way to look at it though is Is the purpose of the data scientist to recite a number, or is the purpose of the data scientist to implement change within their organization? You know, you're getting paid you're not getting paid to crunch numbers. You're getting paid to guide the product team to go do something, to guide the exec team, to, you know, be an evangelist for the customer within within your org. And so, there is a very, delicate balance between Balancing all those details because there's no right answer, and no stakeholder wants to look at a spreadsheet. They want they want the takeaway. So, like, that's another skill, which Storytelling is a whole another subtopic that I'll probably put in that long form piece too. That's

Yeah. So after Salesforce, I had gotten the, director role, And I was managing a team, and, the team that I was on Went through a bit of a turbulent time, and my thought process was a bit more, Not closed minded, shortsighted, I guess you could say. So I the the solution to my unhappiness at work was, Basically, it wasn't like, oh, let's go find another job at Salesforce. It wasn't like you know, I applied to a few other start up jobs to see how I could do it, to see if it would go. And I was I I actually applied to Waymo way back Then and the recruiter, very lovely woman said, you've never done a startup before. Are you sure you can handle it? And it's like, what? What? Who do you think I am? No. No. It's it's whatever. But, so that ended that ended up not working. And then, you know, I was I was with my wife, on a small vacation, like, a week vacation, and We had decided to, go do the travel thing again. Mhmm. And so this is round 2 when when did the travel thing, but this time with my then girlfriend at the time, And we went to Bali, and this time we actually lived in 1 spot for a while. So we're in Bali for, you know, 4 months, and we got a spot and chilled out there for a little bit. The oh, the other difference between this one too is it wasn't just pure travel. I was, working on projects. So I was, like, building apps and, like, you know, coding away and Do you have

That's it.

Things like that? It was it was me messing around. Like, I was I was just I was Building Python WebOps. Like, I was just like, I was just doing it. I was just, like, exploring my own, my own curiosities. I started a small side project, small business. That was a good passion project, but it didn't it made a little bit of money, but it wasn't it wasn't much. But, yeah, left Salesforce because, also, I I I was pretty sure I wanted to leave there. But before I got my next job, I wanted to do the travel thing. And, You know, my, then girlfriend, now wife, and I were just, excited to go on this adventure together. And so we ended up doing that. It was fabulous. Like I said, I started a small project where, I started making, you know, those 3 d mountains, like the 3 d relief mountains that people sometimes have Where it's, like, either, like, CNC out of wood. And it's, like, literally, like, a physical people are holding. Yeah. I wanted to make those, but for, but in but in bronze. Right? Impressive. Okay. Yeah. So it's a it's a big long process, but it dealt with a lot of 3 d printing and 3 d modeling, and then I made them over in bronze. There's a whole website

Well, that's right. That's that's where I started learning the process because it's manufacturing. And so, like, I had no idea how to make these things in the 1st place. And so Bali kicked me off, and I learned all the things not to do when I was in Bali. And then when I came back to California, it was a little bit easier. The website for that is terra mano.co. If anybody wants to go check that out

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, I ended up doing that, and it it didn't it didn't really work. It didn't really work out like I needed it to. And so, I started applying to jobs, And, I've learned in my career that the way you go get a job is you don't apply through the front door, like ubers.career.com. You You hit the ground and you go emailing. You go cold emailing and cold, you know, cold in charge of the people. And that's what I ended up doing, to my next role over digits. I hit up both the founders. I gave them the quick pitch. They were into it. I leaned back on my Salesforce name, and I, I went for it. And I guess I should say this too because I think it's kinda interesting for a data audience. As I was leaving Salesforce, I had a mentor tell me During a 1 on 1, hey, Greg. I think you should shoot more. You should shoot for more than being just the data person. And I go I go, what do you mean? And she goes, you're advising a lot of the decision makers. So you'll come up with an analysis, and you'll recommend To product, what they should do. You'll recommend to the GM what they should do, but you're never the one making the actual decision. And so if you wanna get further along in that realm, I think you're gonna have to go outside the data world. And so it it I was shook after that. I was like, who am I anymore? I don't know. What is my what is my purpose? What is my personality? And so since I learned that, since I had that realization or insight from her, I have explored data adjacent careers, and that's what I specifically explored within the startup. I told the founders like, hey. I did growth over at Salesforce. That's no problem for me. Like, that's gonna be good. Frameworks, all that other stuff, I'll do that in my sleep. What I wanna grow into those, I wanna grow into the COO track. So that doesn't mean I wanna be your COO. That means I wanna point that direction and start to go that route. So help with the monetization model, help with rev ops, Help with stitching together all our SaaS applications. Be the Zapier and automations expert within the org. You know, do all your product analytics, stand up your ETL process. So it's much, much more than just doing data analysis. And so that's what I ended up doing at Digits, which was a fabulous learning experience. I mean, the team was extremely smart, great engineers, great founders, and it it was a lovely time, and I ended up being with them for for 3 years. So it it was it was a solid time.

Yeah. Good I mean, good question. So, no. I so Like I said, at the beginning of COVID, I did, like, 2 months of the pandas stuff. Right?

2 months, and my play was the SEO play. And so I stopped after 2 months, and I did nothing. Right? For the 1st, like, 3 months, there was no traffic. And then in month 4, after I did all that stuff, then it was a little bit, it was a little bit more. Then it was a little bit more, and it peaked up at, 90,000 uniques a month for the site just off of Panda's tutorials, which is pretty sweet. And, and I tried getting b to b sponsors, but the problem was that I picked the wrong content. Man, I picked the reason why I was wrong is because remember in the days before any LLM support, If you had a question on, like, coding anything, you'd Google it, go to Stack Overflow, copy some code, and then leave, and then just go somewhere else. Right? The same thing was happening to my I optimized it for a click in, click out. Nobody stayed on my website. Nobody nobody not no emails, no retention, no the bounce rate was absurd. No time. Everything was everything was not great for that. So, if If anybody wants to talk about it, that's a whole different topic. So did that. And then in January of this past year, over that time, I'd culminated, like, it was 2,000 subscribers on YouTube, which whatever. I wasn't even paying attention to it. It was, like, maybe a dollar a day in Out of sense or whatever. It it wasn't anything. It was so little that I would have to, like, let, like, 2 months build up before I hit the payment threshold, and they just send me the check. Right. But then I, I saw the Hacker News show Show Hacker News Blog post for Langchain. Mhmm. And I was reading the comments. I had no idea what it was. I was I read the comments, and the comments were weirdly optimistic. And you know news comments. They're, like, usually, like, freaking coming with their pitchforks for anything new. And I read that, and I was like, oh, This is interesting. And I'd already started to mess around with the OpenAI API just a little bit, and then I looked more deeply into LinkedIn. And I was like, holy cow. This is solving all the hard parts of working with the OpenAI API right now. And I just thought to myself, what pandas is to data analysis, Lang chain seems to be to the LLM world.

And I was like, oh, yeah. This is great. And the cool part about language models is that the barrier to entry is super low. It's not a deeply, deeply technical topic, and people are figuring all this stuff out in the beginning, like, just to start. And so I made my 1st video, just a Loom freaking video, you know, going on. Yeah. And I put up on YouTube. It was like an intro to Langchain or, like, Lang chain 101 or whatever. And, that next day, I had I was getting, like, 3 or 4 subscribers a day just off my old content from 2 years ago. And then, I got 16 new subscribers after that LinkedIn video. I was like, oh, that's kinda cool. Mhmm. That's sweet. And then the next day, it was 25. I didn't even put on a new video. It was 25 the next day.

like, wait a minute. What? And so I I started pumping out videos, And it went to 45 new subscribers in a day, and then it went to a100. I was like, what is going on here? And I'm telling my wife, I go, babe, this doesn't ever happen. It's like, you have a game for long enough that this does not happen like this. Uh-huh. And so I would say I put my foot on the gas pedal About 30% as much as I probably should have back then. Because, like, if you remember the early 23 hype, I mean, that was just nuts. It was just all over the place. And I started doing stuff. I was full time on it. I was, like, making content. I was really just following my curiosities, like exploring these new things. Right? Right. Like, even the concept of email generation was not it was novel back then.

And it was take something about the company, Take an email template, and it will output a personal it was novel. Right?

It was it was just a it was the it was a wild time. Anyway, so I'm doing that, and it peaked at 550 new subscribers in a day, which, again, isn't a ton, but it was really cool. It was trans transformational at that at that time for me. And so now in August of 23, we're at 33,000 subscribers, and I've told myself that it doesn't get interesting until you until you hit a 100 k. And so that's that's the next milestone, but we'll we'll see if we wanna get there or not.

Well, I need to put on more content for it first. And so y'all didn't you y'all didn't ask about the evolution of how I approach content because that's changed a whole bunch too. And what what was me just doing tutorials, like, on Loom? I asked myself, Greg, if you wanted to take this to the Level. Like, if you if you really wanna give this a good shot, what do you what do you need to do for it? Right. So there's a there's a whole list of things that I thought about, but that's a different topic, and I don't wanna jump into it if y'all don't wanna take it there.

Yeah.

With the YouTube part?

I mean, it's all connected. You know? I mean Yeah. Every everyone everyone's a is a is a list of experiences. Like I said at the beginning, I think my content has resonated well because I spent so much time doing stakeholder management at Salesforce, Learning what are their goals? What is gonna be impactful to business? How do I spend my energy? And then it was that same thing at the at the start up, but at that point, it's like, there's no corporate crib that you're in. You're, like, you're up against the raw world, and users may or may not like your product. And you gotta figure out what the heck you're gonna do. Right? And so between all those things, I think it set me up into a good position to be like, okay. What are cool, impactful Projects that I wanna do to showcase these language models, which areas aren't explored that I think will do well, and then you combine that with my scrappy Python skill. I tell people all the time that It won't be performant, and it probably won't be secure, but you're gonna be able to read it like plain English because, I need it simple. If I'm gonna teach a technical topic, I need it dead simple. So it's heavily commented. That's why I love Jupyter Notebooks because you the markdown in between, all that good stuff. And so did that combine that with the YouTube stuff that I did a couple years prior? I mean, I think it's cool. I mean, y'all and I you you and You 2 and I are talking right now, but, like, by no means do I consider what I've done a success at all so far. Like, there's a long way to go To get to where I want and took for my goals. And so it almost feels a little premature to be talking, and I wish that this podcast was, like, in, like, 3 or 4 years. And maybe we'll

Round 2. Yeah. We'll do round 2. But, but, no, man. It's a journey. It's fun. Yeah. It's true. It's fun.

Yeah. So one of my key learnings was through a creator coach. His name is Jay. He's been great so far. He he made it pretty clear to me. Like, hey, Greg. You're not gonna out expert anybody. Like, you're not gonna out expert anybody. That hit me hard. Number 2 is, Greg, you don't wanna be in the game Where you're trying to say that your list of 10 things is better than someone else's list of 10 things. That's not a good place to be in as a creator. Right? And so he's really helping me work on what he calls the premise, which is who are you, and why do you do what you do? And how do you position yourself so that you're competing against no one else? It's just you. So there's a bajillion AI newsletters out there. There's a bajillion AI content and bajillion AI tutorials and all that out there. Right? How can I Formulate my premise that others won't say that they do? Right? And so he's helping me really, really narrow in on where that is. I'm not quite ready to share Exactly what it is. Because it's still it's still been figured out, but but, think of it as how do you create a trailer for you, Greg, About the journey that you're on and what you do. So he he's he's been helping me a lot with that, and it's been really nice. I'll let you know how that goes afterwards. But then it's, like, also little things. It's like, how do you upgrade your setup? You know? How do you sound better? How do you just do small tactical things? I was talking to 1 audience member really early in my journey, And I go, hey. So I haven't really put that much time into my setup. What do you think? He goes, well, there's 2 types of audience members, Greg. So there's the ones who don't give a shit, and there's The people who really care for the good production. He goes, I care for good production, so I think you should really end up saying that, So, like, little things like that. And then just recently, I started working with an editor. Because if I really looked at the content process, like, What takes the most time? Freaking video editing. Right? Yeah. And in the day of good YouTube, good YouTube is edited. There is a story. Mhmm. Right? And so I'm writing the scripts because that's the content. That's my bread and butter, and I'm getting better at that. It's not by no means there yet, but the tactical editing, I I needed to outsource because I wasn't good at it, and it was taking a lot of time. And it degraded my content a little bit because, You know, it wasn't as good. Now there's some people that'll say, oh, I want the content to speak for itself. And if you're Andrei McCarthy And you can put up a Thank you. About how to do a transformer from scratch. Yeah. Of course. You're gonna get 3,000,000 views, and You're gonna do great. I mean, that's fabulous. That isn't the type of positioning that I can lean back on, Nor do I necessarily want to. I'm trying to position myself in another type of way. And so with that comes a little the need for a little bit more editing.

That's that's exactly it. Because If we're if you're if I'm really harping on the content side, I mean, content is an equation. Right? You have your audience funnel, but then you also have your content operations funnel. How many ideas can you get? How many of the of those ideas can you execute on? And then how well do those ideas actually end up doing? Right? That's the content side, but then you have your whole, like, audience side, Which is the discovery. I think Jay Klaus puts it as the audience platforms and discovery platforms, and then your relationship platforms, And owning your media, there's just it's so so deep, but Yeah. The operator in me enjoys the game of it all. Like, it it's fun. I mean Yeah. I I wish that it was paying just a little bit more right now so I could, like, I could go to a party and, like, Not have to, like, front. You know what I mean? You can't, like, front, like, how things are going with it. But, no, it's it's beautiful. It's a fun time, and, I have an extremely supportive wife who helps me throughout the process.

Yeah. You know, sometimes people say, Greg, let's connect on LinkedIn. And I'm like, why? Like, what, like, for what? I that's a little bit of a me that's a little bit of a jerk thing to say. No. I don't I don't really do LinkedIn. So I would say Twitter is good. And I think if you search hard enough, you could find my email. I don't necessarily wanna give it, but,

you can you I mean, My my DMs are open on Twitter, and they will be for the foreseeable future. So, just hit me up there.
