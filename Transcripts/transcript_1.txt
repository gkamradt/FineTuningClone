And last guy ride into it. So, Dan, like, who's who's with us today?

00:00:37 Dan: Today, we're joined by, Greg Kamrad. I wanna make sure I'm Saying your last name right.

00:00:43 Greg: Kamrad. Kamrad.

00:00:45 Dan: Kamrad.

00:00:46 Greg: Mhmm.

00:00:46 Dan: Great Kamrad. Greg's a data scientist, entrepreneur, has been a corporate leader, and, many of us, including Michael and myself know him from being an insightful voice for anyone who wants to learn about the latest Large language model technologies, particularly recently, the Langchain library, and applying them to real, business problems or or productivity and life problems. Sure. Maybe not all life problems just yet, but Yeah.

00:01:20 Greg: We'll get there.

00:01:21 Dan: Yeah. But Michael and I both been learning a ton from Greg's YouTube channel and newsletter. But before that, Greg built a strong corporate career. He spent time leading a data science team at Salesforce, and building the data start up digits. So we have a ton to learn from his story. Greg, welcome to The Craft.

00:01:44 Greg: Awesome. Thank you very much for having me, and I'm excited to dive into it today.

00:01:49 Dan: Yeah. So so let's start with, your superhero origin story. Who who was young Greg? Were there any signs that this kid would would grow up to teach teach data science and AI on YouTube?

00:02:03 Greg: Yeah. There's 0 signs. Well, maybe you could talk to my parents then. There might have been something there. No. I mean, it's, no. No early signs there. I I can't say that I have an origin story. It all kinda started when I had my 1st job out of school. I was doing corporate FP and A, and what that means is that you're doing big budgets for other companies. Right? And so the very first instance that I knew that I was a spreadsheet minded kind of data nerd was they would give you a list of transactions, and then this just looked like absolute gibberish When I first saw it, and it was a bunch of rows, bunch of, you know, bunch of columns, had no idea how to get into it. And they said, Greg, go extract an insight from this data. And so all of a sudden, it was me needing to dive into the spreadsheet and go pull out a story. Because once you have the numbers, well, then you gotta go present them to people too. And so, I found that I weirdly enjoyed that. I turned into an Excel monkey, and I was using the keyboard, no mouse. And I could really kinda just Feel the spreadsheet and go get good stuff from it. So I would say that was the 1st instance when I knew that, hey, Greg. You should probably lean into this a little bit more.

00:03:12 Dan: Right. Well, that that's the data side, but most data people don't don't end up, you know, on On on a camera sharing stuff with large audiences.

00:03:23 Greg: Yeah. You know? So I guess my first four 4 way 4 way into it was, back in o nine, actually. And I didn't I did tutorials on YouTube, but it wasn't for what you'd think it'd be. It was, it was Photoshop tutorials. Wow. So for some because back then, we're talking old school Photoshop o nine. And photo editing kinda just, like, blew my mind because you had this thing that you think looks static, but then all of a sudden you can apply your creativity and switch the colors and do all this other fun stuff to it. And it was back when photo editing was still hard. So I would teach people how to go do some of the stuff, and I threw it on YouTube. No face, No name. No personal brand. No nothing. I had no idea what I was doing. So those are my first videos, back back in 09. I was And I know I'll date myself a little bit here, but I was 19 at that time doing my 1st videos on YouTube.

00:04:18 Dan: Yeah. And that was fairly early days for doing tutorial type stuff on

00:04:23 Greg: Oh, yeah. I mean, it was early days, YouTube. I mean, we're talking, like, You know, now there's much there's enough CSS to make it look nice and flowy, and it looks modern. Back then, we're still talking no rounded corners, sharp edges. Like Right. The old school Myspace looking type of YouTube versus, what we have today.

00:04:38 Dan: Right. Yeah. But you must have gotten some kind of, like, Positive feedback from those early early forays that that that gave you the, I guess, the confidence, the interest to keep doing it throughout your career.

00:04:51 Greg: You know, I would say it, introduced me to the topic, which I thought was cool. Right? But I was doing random videos. I did Videos of my stepbrother. I did Photoshop tutorials. I did, like, stop motion animation videos, kind of scrolling everything that's up there. Yeah. I took a stop motion class at, at college, which was really fun. But what really convinced me to, like, double down on it and, like, go hard on it Was, during COVID at the beginning of COVID, I was reading I was just reading a bunch of business books, and one of those was, the rich dad, poor dad one. And I liked half the book. The first half, I really like. The second half was kinda just way out there for me, but what they really drill into is the concept of assets. Right? And I know everybody knows this, but assets are things that you put your energy into, and they end up compounding for you, right, when you stop putting your energy into it. We usually think of it as, financial assets. You know? You go make an investment. But another huge type of asset is a content asset. So much like y'all are doing with your content right now, after we record this video, the video is gonna live on forever, and people will be able to see that and keep on viewing on it. And it's gonna do work for you while you're not working anymore. So that motivated the heck out of me. And so I started This is, like, you know, like I said, like, 2020, so beginning in COVID. I doubled down on content, but specifically for data analysis. So I was teaching people how to do pandas, Which is a popular Python library. And the way that I did it is I took the 60 most popular pandas functions by SEO strength. And so the most Googled Uh-huh. To the least Googled. And, really, I didn't like anybody's content out there because there was either, Like, automated content, which wasn't very good. This was before LLMs, and so it was, like, really bad content. Or there was, like, kinda like lifeless one off tutorials that really weren't really done at scale. So I said, you know, I'm gonna do this different, and I'm gonna go for the high quality play. So I did a video. I did a Jupyter Notebook, and I did a blog post for every single one of those 60, which took 2 months because I did 1 per day. And so that's when I kinda, like, got really into it. And then I'll skip forward to the the front part, but then, late last year, You know, g Chativity is coming out. AI is getting huge. And I looked, and there was a lack of content and educating people how to do this type of material on, especially YouTube. And I kinda just it hit me. I was like, dude, you gotta redo what you did for pandas, but you gotta do it for this. Right. Because this it almost felt like my pandas work. At the time, it felt like it was like, the, the the ends. Like, oh, I just did that. It's just sitting over there, whatever. But looking back in it, it's almost like that trained me to really, really take advantage of this opportunity now and to connect with a whole lot of people. So when I started doing this AI stuff, It wasn't from scratch, and so I learned some things along the way, and I I think that helped me out a little bit.

00:07:48 Dan: Yeah. That makes a ton of sense. Because I think to to onlookers and even to, I think us when we we started doing these podcasts, like, we look at, people who've been doing it for years, and it's just they look fully formed As as your videos today do, but there's, like, there's a buildup over time. There's probably a 1000000 little Tips and tricks and just good practices that

00:08:17 Greg: Yeah.

00:08:17 Dan: That you build up over time. I guess starting in 2009 with With Photoshop Photoshop

00:08:22 Greg: tutorials. Right?

00:08:24 Dan: Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. But so so that's just one kind of aspect of, kinda your your early life and and career. But you didn't you you were a very busy kid, in in college, you had worked a bunch of, like, service jobs during college, and I found in my life, Those are some of the jobs where I learned the most. Mhmm. What did your experience in different service jobs, like, teach you About about life and how Sure. You wanted to spend your time.

00:09:01 Greg: Yeah. So the reason why those came around is I went to Layla Marymount down in Los Angeles, California. And, it's a very expensive school. And after I got down with freshman year, my dad told me he pulled me to the side. He said, hey, Greg. You can't pay for your other 3 years like you paid for freshman year. You're gonna be way too in debt because I pulled out a fat student loan freshman year, I'm an 18 year old guy. I I mean, not 18 year old guy, but 18 year old kid. I have no idea what money means. Right? Especially in the in the tens of 1,000 of dollars that we're talking about for student loans. And so I looked at my options in sophomore year. I went to community college. And what's wild is that community college, The same year that cost me tens of 1,000 of dollars at LMU was $700 for the entire year at community college. Yeah. Credits transferred. Everything was just fine, which is which is wild to me. But the reason why I could go back to LMU for junior and senior year It's because I joined a program that they had called the student worker program. And if it wasn't for that program, I wouldn't I've gone back to Elmview. It completely changed my college directory. And so the a trajectory. And the way that it worked was you got a full time job, And they they paid something like it was half to 3 quarters of your college tuition. But you the full time job was working on campus, so sometimes it was trash duty. Sometimes it was, you know, setting up chairs for graduation. Sometimes it was, you know, rolling around and doing odd jobs for professors and things like that. Yeah. So, I mean, it was amazing for me. Right? And not only that, but it really instilled the value of, working to earn your place at this at this university. So I didn't have the luxury of falling back and having, It being paid for through whatever through whatever means. Right. And so through financial aid, through student work, and I ended up, going back. And Junior year, I think I took out maybe, like it's either 5 or 10,000 for a student loan. And then senior year, I didn't have to take out a loan because of financial aid and because of the student worker program. So Yeah. It was a really, really big thing for me, at the time.

00:11:09 Dan: Yeah. That's amazing. And you made it through, and I guess you you made it out with with lower, almost no no debt, which is which is hard.

00:11:20 Greg: I I wanna go that far because I was still carrying my freshman year, like massive amount. So Right.

00:11:24 Dan: That's,

00:11:25 Greg: they give you a 6 months grace grace period after you graduate where your bank doesn't that you don't need to pay Payments. Right? Once you get on your feet. I remember that I had a high interest rate at that time. What would I thought what I thought was I, it was, like, 7 or 8%. Right? Yeah. I was like

00:11:40 Dan: Well, we're back there now.

00:11:42 Greg: Well, we're back there now, but, you know, as a as a kid. And I just remember my mind being blown where I'm just making up numbers. I have no idea what it actually were, but I put in $1,000 towards my student loan, And my balance only goes down $200.

00:11:55 Dan: Right.

00:11:55 Greg: And I'm like, what just happened? Anyway, so that was my lesson into interest rates, you know, way back then, which, you know, that's a whole another story too because the thing that helped me pay off my student loans was really getting a a higher paying job. Like, I know a lot of people are, like, just grind and put everything you can into it, but it wasn't until I got a higher paying job that I could really make a dent in my loans. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:20 Dan: And it kinda ties back to the Like, reading rich, bad, dad, poor dad, thinking about the, like, what kinds of assets can you build that will, I mean, we're we're not claiming, passive income or any kinda, secrets to becoming a billionaire, but

00:12:44 Greg: Yeah. Exactly.

00:12:45 Dan: Doing things that could, like, that you could create that then would be, like, useful assets in instead of, debt, which is what

00:12:57 Greg: Yeah. That's exactly it.

00:12:59 Dan: What a what a lot of college students kind of end up with through throughout, their lives. But so you were also, active in other ways in in college. You, joined the, fraternity Sigma Chi, but you weren't just, like, a member. You, I think, were were president.

00:13:18 Michael: Yeah.

00:13:18 Dan: What did you learn there about, Building community. I'm sure there because I would imagine there were probably parallels to building teams and maybe even building a a YouTube community, later on in your You're correct. Or maybe not.

00:13:33 Greg: You YouTube YouTube maybe, but e but either way, the fraternity was a hugely transformational process for me at, at LMU, I mean, it it was my life. Right? And so I joined 2nd semester freshman year, and I was through it through the rest. It was an amazing opportunity, not only because of the service that we all did too. So we did a lot of community service, but then the brotherhood with all the With all the guys that you're hanging out with and the involvement in school, it just was a very active way to participate in university. And it's not for everybody. Totally cool. It resonated well with me, and I liked it. And so what was I gonna say about oh, yeah. So, Going in it was, like, 2nd semester junior year, and there's about to be, elections for leadership positions in the fraternity. And I forget where I had this spurt or the energy, but it was one of those quotes of, like, if not you, then who? Right? And Mhmm. You know, I had another Huge spurt of motivation. And I remember sitting in a classroom with a friend and just pounding out kind of like, what is my pitch and, like, like, what is my platform and my campaign and all that, And ended up doing the the rounds because the way that you do elections is, you know, you basically give your presentation in front of everybody, and, The voting process isn't very sophisticated. It's, yeah, raise of hands. But Yeah. Anyway, I ended up getting it, and, that was my 1st leadership position. And Right. More than anything, it instilled into me the confidence that, hey, dude. If you want something, go after it. And then now because of this confidence that I had, it had me do other leader other leadership positions throughout life, Which that was the really first big stepping stone that made me believe in myself, which was which was really awesome. The other lesson that I learned while being president, Which I'll say right now, that is carried with me through life is, getting the fraternity to do anything was a big pain in the ass. Right? Mhmm. If you needed volunteers or something, if you needed, well, basically volunteers for a lot of things. And if you send out a text message to the fraternity wide channel, nobody would respond. Right? And I'm looking at the at the room while I'm having one of my chapter meetings. I'm thinking to myself, But that's so weird because if I asked anybody individually, they would say, yes. Of course. Dude, Greg, I got you. No problem. So at that moment, I realized, if you want to get support with somebody, you really need the connection with them, and you should really reach out 1 on 1 Because then they're gonna do any they're they'll do anything you need for them. But doing a mass email or a mass text message, it's a recipe for disaster.

00:16:07 Dan: Yeah. Right. That's a that's a key key leadership insight for dealing with groups. And Yeah. Yeah. And the same is true if They're your employees, and you're and you're paying them versus volunteers. The same dynamic occurs. Right?

00:16:24 Greg: Yeah. Exactly.

00:16:26 Dan: So then, you took those lessons forward, and then, after college, you you mentioned getting into corporate finance. Yeah. Initially and and you kind of had the spark of, like, finding insight and data and then taking it to, You know, other other team members and explaining it. Yeah. But, eventually, I guess you you fell out of love with With corporate finance and more in love with with data science.

00:16:54 Greg: Yeah. So I You gotta put my, if I put myself in my shoes back then. Right? I was working in a cubicle. I know it's like it's like funny, but, like, this fully foreign these days. But I was working in a cubicle, and I was doing finance. And Living in the bay, I it was also in the South Bay. So for those with the Bay Area geography, San Francisco's you know, there's a lot going on there. Old school Silicon Valley is gonna be down on the South Bay, and that's where this company was. And so I'm doing finance. It feels like the world is kinda passing me by because I'm hearing all this tech movement. All and I I have nothing to do with product, nothing to do with eng, nothing to do with Building new things, investors of the progress forward. You know? I'm I'm doing budgets. No no hate for anybody doing budgets. Just me as year old, it was not vibing with me well. I'd over my my my clothes are too big. I didn't know how to dress. I had to wear tucked in shirts every day, you know, that type of thing. And so more More than anything, it was just a restlessness to wanna get out. And so I went and traveled, basically. I, I Left, I think, probably, is about 6 months or 7 months or 8 months or something like that. Backpacked Europe. I worked at a hostel in Italy, which is where I got some hospitality experience, which is crazy. It was one of those live work exchanges where they don't pay you, but you can stay there for free and you can eat for free, which is a good deal. Yeah. I mean, I was fabulous. And then I came back to the States, and I had this realization where it's like, Dude, you can't just go land back in San Francisco because then it's like you left and nothing changed, and nothing were was to show of this big, you know, kind of Chapter change that you had in your life. And so I, found myself in DC. And when I was in DC, I started to in inch my way into Python. So at this point, I only knew Excel. But still to this day, And I very, very thoroughly believe that if you know Excel, you can learn to code Python. It is it's not the same, but If you think about Excel, you're working with tabular data. You're working with rows. You're working with columns Yeah. Fields. You're working with if statements. I mean, you're not that far off from doing Python. Yeah. And so I I was doing that, and then, I found a PDF, and I think it was called data mining for Programmers or data mining for practitioners or something? I can share it afterwards for for show notes, but I read that. And the author Made the topic of data science so approachable. Mhmm. It would it blew my mind. And one of the first exercises was to implement A recommendation system. So not only talk about what it is, but then implement it. And it was like, wow. So a recommendation system is only measuring the between users and the ratings that they have on, on, you know, songs or whatever, and then seeing who which user you're you're most similar to and then Recommending something from their library? Yep. That's cool. And so I got inundated on, this idea. And then It but this was just me messing around in my studio. Right? Right.

00:20:01 Dan: How do

00:20:02 Greg: I take it to the next level? This was back this was back in 2015, And it was when, boot camps were big, but Right. Web boot web boot camps were big, and mobile boot camps were big. Mhmm. There was no data science boot camps. There was 1, and it was called Zipfian Academy. And they had just started, but I I looked at their website, And it said, of our graduates, 95% get a job within 6 months, and your Average out of job salary is double what I was making at corporate finance. So I was like Good stats. I like this. It's a technical skill, which I know is in high demand. I'm probably gonna get a job, and my job is probably gonna pay me double. Yeah. Sure. I'll go and do this. So I applied, and I took an interview. I have no idea why they ended up taking me. There was 1 section on the stats that I just completely bombed with, Poisson distributions and things like that. It was wild. So I did that. Anyway, ended up getting in. I got my student loans delayed for another 3 months because the the third party lender, Wells Fargo, actually was very generous, and they it was a it was an out of or it was an Uncommon request that I say, hey. Can you stop this? For this this time, because it's another schooling. I'm trying to better myself, etcetera. They were down for it. They stopped it. I took the program. I went heads down for three and a half months, like, 12 hours a day. That's where I picked up Python, picked up pandas. It hit the job market hard and ended up getting a job at Salesforce. That really changed I mean, that changed Changed my entire career. Not only was my career identity different, but I was getting paid more. And I was now in San Francisco in the tech scene, so it it totally changed it for me.

00:21:47 Dan: Wow. Yeah. So cool that you kind of, like, saw this, what you wanted to be doing. And then over, I guess, the course of several months taken, I mean, through a lot of hard work, but you you Made that transition happen, and then you ended up on on this trajectory that probably, like, maybe a year, 2 years before seemed like a total dream.

00:22:12 Greg: Believe me, man. Like, I was in my, I was in my DC studio apartment and, like, really, like, down on myself. Just thinking like, what the heck am I doing? Where am I going? What's the path in life? Where you know, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And the thing that kept the thing that initially turned me on to that, that PDF was I was just tinkering around with stuff. Like Yeah. I was just trying to tinker with data, tinker with a little bit of Python. Like, I had no idea what I'm doing. You know? And, Yeah. And, anyway, so the tinkering got me. It was a good stepping stone to getting forward.

00:22:49 Michael: Awesome. That's pretty cool. Yeah. And, also, like, maybe, go on to that. So, I mean, that since that that has been, like, for a long time. So right now, you're becoming really seasoned and experienced. So, like, how how do you see the, the, the evolution of of the landscape of data data science from your, your perspective.

00:23:13 Greg: Yeah. Totally. Yeah. So back in 2015, that was when the article was coming around that somebody had wrote that was like, oh, data science is gonna be the sexiest job of the 21st century. Remember that whole phase? That was a little while ago. Right? Yeah. It's just it's wild because nobody would say that now. They'd say, you know, like, an ML engineer or something like that. But Right. So that was going on. So At Salesforce, that was a corporate data environment, right, which is completely different than a start up data environment. There's pros and cons to both. Back then, data science was well, there's kinda 2 routes. I mean, it's kinda even the same now. I mean, you have your really, really deep ML, like research academic side, and then you have your more practitioner application. Let's use algorithms to go go do cool things. And that is the that's the route that's the route that I end up going. So I was a person who would use classification algorithms, who would do time series forecasting, who would do regressions and things That to go do product analytics at Salesforce. And so I stepped into this role unbeknownst to me really because I was I was still figuring it out. It was it was a growth rule, Which is a Venn diagram of good data skills, but then also the application side and doing it within product analytics, but then Also trying to storytell to your stakeholders, like, what the heck your recommendation is to go do. Right. So Anyway, so data science back then was kinda like vanilla random forests. Like, that's the easiest way I can like, go spin a scikit learn. Go open up a Jupyter Notebook. Go do a, train test split, and go mess around, and go tune some hyperparameters, and go do grid search to try to find the best ones and, you know, all that other stuff. And that was also when you did did it on with your local datasets. It's like you could load up a lot of datasets within your own Jupyter Notebook. It was no big deal. Now, I mean, The tools are just so much more advanced, and it almost seems like people are moving past the vanilla classification algorithms where if you're using random force, that's almost like You do it because it's only 2 lines of code, and you just wanna try it out. Yeah. You people are moving on to more sophisticated types of things, and, And I I won't I won't speculate about where it's going, but with the AI stuff, there's just a lot more question marks around what types of skills Should you invest in right now, if you wanted to, you know, leverage your energy as much as possible?

00:25:35 Dan: Right.

00:25:37 Michael: Right. And, also, it seems you the LIM, like, recently I mean, it's the reason the ability is getting better, and then, like, we can we can see the 1st demo, of, like, how how how an LM will do, like, like a data data science kind of project. It's It's from the co interpreter on Chatt gbt, with g t four model. And, and that's just seems like the beginning. And because I I got I got a friend, like, who was, also working in data science, and, we were talking about this topic. And And and, yeah. And he was like, okay. Like, may maybe I'll I'll be replaced someday. And and with that so, like, they're they're trying to find, you know, What what's the what's the next direction I'm gonna take in trying to leverage this instead of yeah. Yeah.

00:26:26 Greg: You know, I, It's starting like, the whole, like, oh, maybe I'll get replaced. It's like, yeah, one day for sure, But I like to leave those for, like, kinda, like, philosophical conversations around the fireplace

00:26:41 Michael: Right.

00:26:41 Greg: That type of thing. Like, today, like, Actual. Like, if I'm a college student just about to graduate, what am I doing today? I'm still learning the fundamentals. I mean, I guess if we're talking about data science, still learning the fundamentals of data science. Until there's a tool that comes out there that There there's always gonna be tools that you need to learn to uplevel in your job. Right? If you're worried about getting replaced, that's a rough place to be in. The advice I would give to you is Stay at the forefront of what's coming out for your specific industry. Yeah. If you do get replaced, it's not gonna happen overnight. It's not gonna be like, hey. Monday morning, you don't have a job anymore. It's gonna be a slow transition. And like any competitive professional, and when I say competitive, I just mean somebody who's active in learning in their in their career, You're gonna have to learn the tools. People had to learn computers. They had to learn the Internet. They learned SAS. You know? Anybody who didn't learn the SAS SAS software, or they were anti that. Well, they didn't get by very long, and they're definitely not having fun right now. So, So I'm not worried about anybody getting replaced right now. I think there's ample opportunity for you to upload their skills all over the place.

00:27:51 Michael: Right. Yeah. I think yeah. Definitely. So I think the, and also yeah. It's actually so, for, for data science, there's, like, actually a lot more, I guess. It's it's just a lot deeper than we usually think, for for, you know, different levels of knowledge and also, value that that, you know, human, or or scientists or, professionals have to do. So it's not like

00:28:20 Greg: Yeah. Yeah. I totally agree. And the other thing too that I think people overlook is A single job function is not a single workflow. Right?

00:28:29 Michael: Right.

00:28:30 Greg: Like, even if we were just take a small example, data scientists, where do they get the requirements from? Well, it's usually a stakeholder that they have that tells them what is a priority for the business and what they need to go do. Okay. So is a stakeholder gonna input a prompt and get to get an answer out? No. So the human is also a huge storyteller and interpreter that comes with it. So I think the most likely example is that data scientists, yes, they'll still have their jobs. Some of their mini workflows will get a little speed boost. Right? Just like, DBT comes out and helps people through the ETL process, and it there's a lot of really cool things with it. A lot of people are learning DBT, and now they're speeding up and they're going faster and things like that. So I think the same thing will happen with AI. Like, Hey. Can you go do exploratory data analysis for me? Go give me some good stuff back. Okay. Cool. Now I'm gonna double click myself and do manually, You know, go dive deeper into a section here, but, no one's getting their job replaced overnight.

00:29:27 Michael: Yeah. Definitely. So, yeah, we're we're also interested, like, are are you building so because, on on the tutorials in your channel, so you're you're Working on, the lantern, and, that was pretty cool because they're really useful and helpful for us, especially, that that we're trying to learn. And, and, are you are you building any, like, exciting or interesting, project projects or products? Or even your, recurring, position at the new at the start up, Digits. Yeah. Yeah. You mind sharing that?

00:30:01 Greg: Yeah. Absolutely. So I actually left my position at Digits. This was in January of this year, so January 2023. And since then, I've I've been on my own, and a major portion of that has been doing, content for the AI space. Now what has been surprising to me is the amount of reaction had come from it. And I think it was a it was a lot of right place, right time, and that's totally that's I mean, I see I see that's totally cool. I think a little bit of it too was that I found a way to try to position content that I think has a little bit of reaction that comes from the from the audience, which is awesome. And so now there's a big open question, which is, hey. When you have YouTube subscriber growth in a little bit, not much, but just a little bit, and you have a little bit of, Twitter growth, What are the routes in front of you to go have some fun? Right? And so the way that I'm answering that question for myself is you have to think about your personal goals, not even career. Like, what kind of life do you want for your family? What life do you wanna live? What how do you wanna grow? Just all those other stuff. You start with what's important to you and your values. And then from there, You back out a plan just like anything else at work. I mean, it's not rocket science. Right? And so, I've done that with myself, and I backed it out. And As of right now, I'm having a lot of fun and getting a lot of good ROI on the content side. And the content side is kind of a it's kind of a trite word that's overused, but, really, I like making cool projects, and I like sharing them with people. And it it it's been fun. Right? And so I think that the piece that I'm leaning into right now Is that though I've gotten popular over tutorials thus far, I don't necessarily wanna keep on doing tutorials. Right? There could be 1 route where I wanna go, do a school type of environment, and I, You know, teach people how to do that. But I've told you my background. At my core, I'm not a software engineer. Right? I'm a b to b products guy who really, really likes seeing product scale. I really like extracting an insight from a customer and figuring out what to build. I really like looking at a market landscape and figuring out how do we position ourselves for it. I really like data analysis. I real you know, I like a lot of other things that come with it. And so I think a school prod, maybe not quite yet, especially on the software engineering side. And then On the, company side, that is 100% in my purview for sure, but I don't wanna I don't wanna rush into it. I wanna do something that's, like, When it hits me and I the right people come into play, the right idea comes into play, then I wanna say, you know what? I'm ready to go tackle that for now. However, The content side right now, people often say how you make content and ends it ends up being a top of funnel for you. It's absolutely true because a lot of cool opportunities have come, a lot of speaking opportunities, a lot of meeting really cool people, lot lot of meeting really cool VCs, And meeting really cool sponsors too, so I'm starting to do a little bit of sponsorship content, for for for the content. But my my approach right now, like I said, I'm this is being long winded, but I said, I don't wanna be just known for tutorials. So if If I think about the intersection of business in the AI space, I think to myself, what really, really excites me right now? And the thing that just freaking fascinates me so much is Where is value gonna accrue in the AI space in business? Like, how is AI gonna help business people do more? Like, I'm not talking about Which jobs are gonna get replaced? I'm talking about today. Like, the marketing person on your team, they log in on Friday morning. What could they be doing today that's gonna help your business out? And talking to people about that, hearing those stories, It's just it's just been extremely fun. So the last thing I'll say, then I'll pass it back to y'all is I just heard about this concept of the AI committee at the workspace. Right? I had no idea what this was. I was talking to a VC. They said, yeah. We're starting our AI committee at work right now. I said, what's that? They said, oh, well, it's a group of employees That are tasked with figuring out what we should do internally to get better at AI at our workplace. I was like, oh, that's kinda interesting. And I tell my wife that, and she goes, We just got an email about that today. We have our own group doing that right now. And so this is the perfect type of problem and just such an interesting thing that I'm really fascinated by. So I sent out a tweet, and I ended up getting 12 user research interviews of people who are doing AI committees. And it's like, heck, yeah. Let's talk about this. What are you doing? What's what's not working? And so I'm putting out a video on that probably later this month, on what I learned from it. But those are the types of things that I found I found really interesting.

00:34:29 Michael: That is cool. That is very cool. Yeah. I'm glad that that you're, hop on your new new journey, and it feels like really exciting. And, and also maybe 1 last, question on this topic is that, like, you back in, when when we're at the data intelligence team, Mhmm. At salesforce, and you you you worked, you know, you you you you start from the doing data sign data science, data And then you became the director of the team and leading a a a bunch of data scientists, I guess. But so is there any, valuable lessons that you learned, through the process? Like, especially in a corporate, studying data science field, and you became a leader in this field. And, Yeah.

00:35:18 Greg: Yeah. I would say that the biggest one that's standing out to me even today is the amount of storytelling that happens within a corporate data team. Now if you're in academia and you're doing research and you're doing deep ML, okay, there's not a ton of storytelling that goes in there, and that's okay. You know, you're you're doing your research project. But when you're in a corporate environment and you have stakeholders and you only have so much energy that you can expend, you have to make sure that that expenditure is going to good use. Right? So, I have, I have a topic for a very long form article, potentially even longer. That's all around the empathy that an analyst needs to build before they can do good data analysis. And it's it's really 3 parts. Right? So you need stakeholder empathy, which means you need to know what their priorities are. You need to know what's important to them. You need to know where the business is going, and you need to know, what they'll react to and, like, what you need to do. Right? Mhmm. Number 2 is customer empathy. So who is your customer? What are they doing? Have you looked at the usage logs 1 by 1 to really get a feeling for what they're doing? Have you done user research interviews, and and all that. And then the last one, which maybe is I should have said first because it's Carl Lane, but It's product empathy. So do you know your product inside and out? Salesforce is a very complicated product. Now that's just just a sales piece It's complicated. But then there's platform, and then there's mobile, and then there's the ecosystem, and then there's app exchange and all that other stuff. It gets very complicated very quickly. And if you don't have all 3 of those pieces as a data person, you're not gonna have a good time, and your impact is not gonna be as much as it as the next person who has all 3 of those things. So what I learned at Salesforce was that there is an immense amount of nondata skill that one needs to learn in order to be an effective data person, in a corporation like that.

00:37:13 Michael: I see. Especially, I think, in the business setting, and also, Yeah. It's like, how do you the the data science is, the the data is your, is your tool and your Weapon to how do you, like, how do you use this to based on the person. Right?

00:37:31 Greg: That's exact that's exactly and so I another saying I have is, like, Analysis does no good if it just stays on your local computer. Right. Mhmm. Right? It's like even if you came up with the most groundbreaking freaking money making thing analysis. Right? How you infect the org with that insight is also a skill that is, that is hard to do.

00:37:55 Dan: Right. Yeah. And I think those 3 points also speak to, like, a a core issue I see in A lot of data science I see at work, whereas, like, models can give you numbers, Which are which sounds like a great answer to whatever the problem is, but and and you can, Maybe someone's very good at selling the numbers and convincing other people to make decisions based on that, but whether the numbers actually mean anything or not, Whether the model is any good, a lot of times, like, the end the, like, the end users are are Can be easily duped for a while. Mhmm. And that's like a that's a hard thing to balance, I think, In data science. Because there there's, like, this really strong information asymmetry. And, like, you can give these results. Yeah. But the value of the results, whether they're they're they're good or not, like, has this time lag before everyone knows it.

00:39:03 Michael: Yeah.

00:39:04 Dan: And that's, like, a big challenge I see a lot.

00:39:07 Greg: Yeah. You're you're you're absolutely right. And You're hinting at something that doesn't get talked about a ton, but you're, I think information asymmetry is a great way to put it because the data person is Extremely intimate with the data, knows how dirty it is, know all knows all the exceptions and everything. An interesting way to look at it though is Is the purpose of the data scientist to recite a number, or is the purpose of the data scientist to implement change within their organization? You know, you're getting paid you're not getting paid to crunch numbers. You're getting paid to guide the product team to go do something, to guide the exec team, to, you know, be an evangelist for the customer within within your org. And so, there is a very, delicate balance between Balancing all those details because there's no right answer, and no stakeholder wants to look at a spreadsheet. They want they want the takeaway. So, like, that's another skill, which Storytelling is a whole another subtopic that I'll probably put in that long form piece too. That's

00:40:07 Dan: yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so so you had this kinda this this career at Salesforce, and we talked a little bit about, like, your Your transitions, but, you know, how how did you decide to leave? So first, I guess, the 1st transition was from a big corporate To a start up. Mhmm. So what was the thinking then, and and what was the plan?

00:40:32 Greg: Yeah. So after Salesforce, I had gotten the, director role, And I was managing a team, and, the team that I was on Went through a bit of a turbulent time, and my thought process was a bit more, Not closed minded, shortsighted, I guess you could say. So I the the solution to my unhappiness at work was, Basically, it wasn't like, oh, let's go find another job at Salesforce. It wasn't like you know, I applied to a few other start up jobs to see how I could do it, to see if it would go. And I was I I actually applied to Waymo way back Then and the recruiter, very lovely woman said, you've never done a startup before. Are you sure you can handle it? And it's like, what? What? Who do you think I am? No. No. It's it's whatever. But, so that ended that ended up not working. And then, you know, I was I was with my wife, on a small vacation, like, a week vacation, and We had decided to, go do the travel thing again. Mhmm. And so this is round 2 when when did the travel thing, but this time with my then girlfriend at the time, And we went to Bali, and this time we actually lived in 1 spot for a while. So we're in Bali for, you know, 4 months, and we got a spot and chilled out there for a little bit. The oh, the other difference between this one too is it wasn't just pure travel. I was, working on projects. So I was, like, building apps and, like, you know, coding away and Do you have

00:42:10 Dan: a lot of leave Salesforce and go on this, like, coding stuff on your own?

00:42:17 Greg: That's it.

00:42:18 Dan: And then was it, like, consulting little projects?

00:42:21 Greg: Things like that? It was it was me messing around. Like, I was I was just I was Building Python WebOps. Like, I was just like, I was just doing it. I was just, like, exploring my own, my own curiosities. I started a small side project, small business. That was a good passion project, but it didn't it made a little bit of money, but it wasn't it wasn't much. But, yeah, left Salesforce because, also, I I I was pretty sure I wanted to leave there. But before I got my next job, I wanted to do the travel thing. And, You know, my, then girlfriend, now wife, and I were just, excited to go on this adventure together. And so we ended up doing that. It was fabulous. Like I said, I started a small project where, I started making, you know, those 3 d mountains, like the 3 d relief mountains that people sometimes have Where it's, like, either, like, CNC out of wood. And it's, like, literally, like, a physical people are holding. Yeah. I wanted to make those, but for, but in but in bronze. Right? Impressive. Okay. Yeah. So it's a it's a big long process, but it dealt with a lot of 3 d printing and 3 d modeling, and then I made them over in bronze. There's a whole website

00:43:27 Dan: In Bali.

00:43:29 Greg: Well, that's right. That's that's where I started learning the process because it's manufacturing. And so, like, I had no idea how to make these things in the 1st place. And so Bali kicked me off, and I learned all the things not to do when I was in Bali. And then when I came back to California, it was a little bit easier. The website for that is terra mano.co. If anybody wants to go check that out

00:43:49 Dan: mono.co. We'll add it through the notes.

00:43:52 Greg: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, I ended up doing that, and it it didn't it didn't really work. It didn't really work out like I needed it to. And so, I started applying to jobs, And, I've learned in my career that the way you go get a job is you don't apply through the front door, like ubers.career.com. You You hit the ground and you go emailing. You go cold emailing and cold, you know, cold in charge of the people. And that's what I ended up doing, to my next role over digits. I hit up both the founders. I gave them the quick pitch. They were into it. I leaned back on my Salesforce name, and I, I went for it. And I guess I should say this too because I think it's kinda interesting for a data audience. As I was leaving Salesforce, I had a mentor tell me During a 1 on 1, hey, Greg. I think you should shoot more. You should shoot for more than being just the data person. And I go I go, what do you mean? And she goes, you're advising a lot of the decision makers. So you'll come up with an analysis, and you'll recommend To product, what they should do. You'll recommend to the GM what they should do, but you're never the one making the actual decision. And so if you wanna get further along in that realm, I think you're gonna have to go outside the data world. And so it it I was shook after that. I was like, who am I anymore? I don't know. What is my what is my purpose? What is my personality? And so since I learned that, since I had that realization or insight from her, I have explored data adjacent careers, and that's what I specifically explored within the startup. I told the founders like, hey. I did growth over at Salesforce. That's no problem for me. Like, that's gonna be good. Frameworks, all that other stuff, I'll do that in my sleep. What I wanna grow into those, I wanna grow into the COO track. So that doesn't mean I wanna be your COO. That means I wanna point that direction and start to go that route. So help with the monetization model, help with rev ops, Help with stitching together all our SaaS applications. Be the Zapier and automations expert within the org. You know, do all your product analytics, stand up your ETL process. So it's much, much more than just doing data analysis. And so that's what I ended up doing at Digits, which was a fabulous learning experience. I mean, the team was extremely smart, great engineers, great founders, and it it was a lovely time, and I ended up being with them for for 3 years. So it it was it was a solid time.

00:46:14 Michael: Yeah. Wow.

00:46:17 Dan: And then, But then, I guess, throughout this whole time, you kept up, like, the YouTube, the content creation, Things on the side?

00:46:29 Greg: Yeah. Good I mean, good question. So, no. I so Like I said, at the beginning of COVID, I did, like, 2 months of the pandas stuff. Right?

00:46:39 Dan: Right.

00:46:39 Greg: 2 months, and my play was the SEO play. And so I stopped after 2 months, and I did nothing. Right? For the 1st, like, 3 months, there was no traffic. And then in month 4, after I did all that stuff, then it was a little bit, it was a little bit more. Then it was a little bit more, and it peaked up at, 90,000 uniques a month for the site just off of Panda's tutorials, which is pretty sweet. And, and I tried getting b to b sponsors, but the problem was that I picked the wrong content. Man, I picked the reason why I was wrong is because remember in the days before any LLM support, If you had a question on, like, coding anything, you'd Google it, go to Stack Overflow, copy some code, and then leave, and then just go somewhere else. Right? The same thing was happening to my I optimized it for a click in, click out. Nobody stayed on my website. Nobody nobody not no emails, no retention, no the bounce rate was absurd. No time. Everything was everything was not great for that. So, if If anybody wants to talk about it, that's a whole different topic. So did that. And then in January of this past year, over that time, I'd culminated, like, it was 2,000 subscribers on YouTube, which whatever. I wasn't even paying attention to it. It was, like, maybe a dollar a day in Out of sense or whatever. It it wasn't anything. It was so little that I would have to, like, let, like, 2 months build up before I hit the payment threshold, and they just send me the check. Right. But then I, I saw the Hacker News show Show Hacker News Blog post for Langchain. Mhmm. And I was reading the comments. I had no idea what it was. I was I read the comments, and the comments were weirdly optimistic. And you know news comments. They're, like, usually, like, freaking coming with their pitchforks for anything new. And I read that, and I was like, oh, This is interesting. And I'd already started to mess around with the OpenAI API just a little bit, and then I looked more deeply into LinkedIn. And I was like, holy cow. This is solving all the hard parts of working with the OpenAI API right now. And I just thought to myself, what pandas is to data analysis, Lang chain seems to be to the LLM world.

00:48:55 Michael: Alright.

00:48:55 Greg: And I was like, oh, yeah. This is great. And the cool part about language models is that the barrier to entry is super low. It's not a deeply, deeply technical topic, and people are figuring all this stuff out in the beginning, like, just to start. And so I made my 1st video, just a Loom freaking video, you know, going on. Yeah. And I put up on YouTube. It was like an intro to Langchain or, like, Lang chain 101 or whatever. And, that next day, I had I was getting, like, 3 or 4 subscribers a day just off my old content from 2 years ago. And then, I got 16 new subscribers after that LinkedIn video. I was like, oh, that's kinda cool. Mhmm. That's sweet. And then the next day, it was 25. I didn't even put on a new video. It was 25 the next day.

00:49:37 Dan: I was

00:49:37 Greg: like, wait a minute. What? And so I I started pumping out videos, And it went to 45 new subscribers in a day, and then it went to a100. I was like, what is going on here? And I'm telling my wife, I go, babe, this doesn't ever happen. It's like, you have a game for long enough that this does not happen like this. Uh-huh. And so I would say I put my foot on the gas pedal About 30% as much as I probably should have back then. Because, like, if you remember the early 23 hype, I mean, that was just nuts. It was just all over the place. And I started doing stuff. I was full time on it. I was, like, making content. I was really just following my curiosities, like exploring these new things. Right? Right. Like, even the concept of email generation was not it was novel back then.

00:50:23 Michael: Right. Right.

00:50:24 Greg: And it was take something about the company, Take an email template, and it will output a personal it was novel. Right?

00:50:30 Dan: Yeah.

00:50:31 Greg: It was it was just a it was the it was a wild time. Anyway, so I'm doing that, and it peaked at 550 new subscribers in a day, which, again, isn't a ton, but it was really cool. It was trans transformational at that at that time for me. And so now in August of 23, we're at 33,000 subscribers, and I've told myself that it doesn't get interesting until you until you hit a 100 k. And so that's that's the next milestone, but we'll we'll see if we wanna get there or not.

00:51:01 Michael: Yeah. Is it it's on his way.

00:51:04 Greg: Well, I need to put on more content for it first. And so y'all didn't you y'all didn't ask about the evolution of how I approach content because that's changed a whole bunch too. And what what was me just doing tutorials, like, on Loom? I asked myself, Greg, if you wanted to take this to the Level. Like, if you if you really wanna give this a good shot, what do you what do you need to do for it? Right. So there's a there's a whole list of things that I thought about, but that's a different topic, and I don't wanna jump into it if y'all don't wanna take it there.

00:51:32 Dan: Yeah. Well, I mean, let's go there because I think that's that's part of the process. Yeah. Because that's, like, that's mastery. And I think at some point, we also just like, you mentioned How how like, having a plan before diving into, like, doing the the YouTube stuff full time.

00:51:53 Greg: Yeah.

00:51:55 Dan: Wanna hear about that too, but it sounds like the they're connected.

00:52:00 Greg: With the YouTube part?

00:52:03 Dan: Yeah. Like, you're, I mean,

00:52:07 Greg: I mean, it's all connected. You know? I mean Yeah. Every everyone everyone's a is a is a list of experiences. Like I said at the beginning, I think my content has resonated well because I spent so much time doing stakeholder management at Salesforce, Learning what are their goals? What is gonna be impactful to business? How do I spend my energy? And then it was that same thing at the at the start up, but at that point, it's like, there's no corporate crib that you're in. You're, like, you're up against the raw world, and users may or may not like your product. And you gotta figure out what the heck you're gonna do. Right? And so between all those things, I think it set me up into a good position to be like, okay. What are cool, impactful Projects that I wanna do to showcase these language models, which areas aren't explored that I think will do well, and then you combine that with my scrappy Python skill. I tell people all the time that It won't be performant, and it probably won't be secure, but you're gonna be able to read it like plain English because, I need it simple. If I'm gonna teach a technical topic, I need it dead simple. So it's heavily commented. That's why I love Jupyter Notebooks because you the markdown in between, all that good stuff. And so did that combine that with the YouTube stuff that I did a couple years prior? I mean, I think it's cool. I mean, y'all and I you you and You 2 and I are talking right now, but, like, by no means do I consider what I've done a success at all so far. Like, there's a long way to go To get to where I want and took for my goals. And so it almost feels a little premature to be talking, and I wish that this podcast was, like, in, like, 3 or 4 years. And maybe we'll

00:53:38 Dan: Let's do it. Yeah.

00:53:39 Greg: Round 2. Yeah. We'll do round 2. But, but, no, man. It's a journey. It's fun. Yeah. It's true. It's fun.

00:53:49 Dan: Yeah. So what are what are, what are the things that, Just the high level, like, from from the early videos to now, like, you you mentioned, if I wanna get serious about this, This is what I need to do differently. What what are what are the key things?

00:54:08 Greg: Yeah. So one of my key learnings was through a creator coach. His name is Jay. He's been great so far. He he made it pretty clear to me. Like, hey, Greg. You're not gonna out expert anybody. Like, you're not gonna out expert anybody. That hit me hard. Number 2 is, Greg, you don't wanna be in the game Where you're trying to say that your list of 10 things is better than someone else's list of 10 things. That's not a good place to be in as a creator. Right? And so he's really helping me work on what he calls the premise, which is who are you, and why do you do what you do? And how do you position yourself so that you're competing against no one else? It's just you. So there's a bajillion AI newsletters out there. There's a bajillion AI content and bajillion AI tutorials and all that out there. Right? How can I Formulate my premise that others won't say that they do? Right? And so he's helping me really, really narrow in on where that is. I'm not quite ready to share Exactly what it is. Because it's still it's still been figured out, but but, think of it as how do you create a trailer for you, Greg, About the journey that you're on and what you do. So he he's he's been helping me a lot with that, and it's been really nice. I'll let you know how that goes afterwards. But then it's, like, also little things. It's like, how do you upgrade your setup? You know? How do you sound better? How do you just do small tactical things? I was talking to 1 audience member really early in my journey, And I go, hey. So I haven't really put that much time into my setup. What do you think? He goes, well, there's 2 types of audience members, Greg. So there's the ones who don't give a shit, and there's The people who really care for the good production. He goes, I care for good production, so I think you should really end up saying that, So, like, little things like that. And then just recently, I started working with an editor. Because if I really looked at the content process, like, What takes the most time? Freaking video editing. Right? Yeah. And in the day of good YouTube, good YouTube is edited. There is a story. Mhmm. Right? And so I'm writing the scripts because that's the content. That's my bread and butter, and I'm getting better at that. It's not by no means there yet, but the tactical editing, I I needed to outsource because I wasn't good at it, and it was taking a lot of time. And it degraded my content a little bit because, You know, it wasn't as good. Now there's some people that'll say, oh, I want the content to speak for itself. And if you're Andrei McCarthy And you can put up a Thank you. About how to do a transformer from scratch. Yeah. Of course. You're gonna get 3,000,000 views, and You're gonna do great. I mean, that's fabulous. That isn't the type of positioning that I can lean back on, Nor do I necessarily want to. I'm trying to position myself in another type of way. And so with that comes a little the need for a little bit more editing.

00:56:57 Dan: Yeah. Wow. Yeah. So cool to to to to hear, like, the The breakdown of these these steps to, like, take it take it to the next level. Because you're, like, at this like you mentioned, like, at this interesting, you know, ho hopefully, in in between phase where the the like, the channel and the content has started to take off in this new way, And it's gonna land, land somewhere, and you're you're figuring out how to like, How to, like, strap strap rockets to it so it can so it can land farther.

00:57:36 Greg: That's that's exactly it. Because If we're if you're if I'm really harping on the content side, I mean, content is an equation. Right? You have your audience funnel, but then you also have your content operations funnel. How many ideas can you get? How many of the of those ideas can you execute on? And then how well do those ideas actually end up doing? Right? That's the content side, but then you have your whole, like, audience side, Which is the discovery.
