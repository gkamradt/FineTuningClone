00:00:00 Greg: And isn't it weird how you can give someone else advice and if you looked at someone else and they had your situation, you'd be like, it's a no brainer on what you should do. You need to do x, y, and z. But when it's your own situation, you get almost tunnel vision or you get, you know, almost like the fog of war, and it's really tough to have a fresh perspective. So That's why it's so good talking to people on the outside who have that fresh perspective and who can tell you with a bit more clarity on what to do.

00:00:22 Ken: I I firmly believe that most people, they really know what they should A lot of the times, success, whether it's in the job search, whether it's in entrepreneurship, whether it's in anything, it is simple. You do certain things And you get the returns. People conflate simple with easy, though. A lot of the time, very simple things are unbelievably difficult. If you can do simple things and And do the difficult tasks to get those simple things done, then you can have success. This episode of Ken's Nearest Neighbors is powered by z by HP, HP's high compute, workstation grade line of products and solutions. Today, I had the pleasure of interviewing Greg at CamRapp. Greg has been in and around data science and analytics his entire career. He's seen it from the corporate side As a director of strategy and growth at Salesforce, then as the 1st business hire at Digits, a series c Fintech Company. This year, he's been focused on teaching thousands of developers and founders how to get started building with AI. He runs Data Independent, A YouTube channel with tutorials and interviews on the AI space. I actually found Greg through his amazing content on the Langchain. In this video, we talk about the best advice Greg ever got around his career, why he thinks Langchain is so special for building AI tools and products, And how he sees an explosion of AI products changing the world. I really enjoyed this conversation with Greg, and I know you will too. Greg, Thank you so much for coming on the Ken's Nearest Neighbors Podcast.

00:01:52 Greg: Ken, thanks for having me, man.

00:01:55 Ken: Yeah, no problem. So I came across your content when I was doing some research on Lang chain. And you have a really awesome entire. Essentially video playlist about learning it and some implementations. And I was like, you know what? I want to talk to this guy. 1, because I want to learn about Langchain. 2, because I think you'd have an interesting story. And, You know, we got to talk and I was like, wow, we, we, we have to have this guy come in because, you know, you're not just a technical practitioner. You have a lot more Nuance to your career and a lot of, really cool background that I think the guests would really enjoy learning from and Getting to experience firsthand. So again, thank you for coming on. I can't wait to dive in to you and your story.

00:02:39 Greg: Awesome. Yeah. You know, it's been a journey. I've been in and out of data for most of my career, so I'm excited to see, to talk

00:02:46 Ken: about it more. Amazing. So a kicking off point I like to start with All of my guests is where you first got interested in data and not everyone follows data careers, but A lot of us are it's integrated with what we're with what we're doing now. Was there a pivotal moment, or was there, Slow progression over time into data.

00:03:08 Greg: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good question. I would say that there's kind of 2 Pivotal pivotal moments. My 1st role out of school. So I'm a fresh fresh out of undergrad, very green in the workplace. And I started my career off in corporate FP and A. And that means I was doing finance and budgets for big corporations in their, their departments. Right? I remember getting an Excel spreadsheet. This was back before Google drive or links or anything like that. So it was just a big massive dirty un version controlled spreadsheet. And, there was a list of transactions throughout the entire page and, you know, call it something like a 100,000 transactions or whatever, more rows than I could count, more columns than I could see. And my boss was basically like, Greg, you tell us what tell us X, Y, Z. Like, I forgot what the question was, but they were like, go figure out the answer within the spreadsheet. And I found that I had a knack for digging into Excel spreadsheets and extracting an answer. Now that may sound a little silly, but if you think about most data out there, it's in tabular form. So that was planting the seeds for me to jump into data analysis, early in my career. Now that was pivotal moment number 1. Number 2 is was around 2015. I found a PDF and it was intro to data science for programmers. And In that PDF, which was basically like an old school tutorial, it taught you how to implement a recommendation system from scratch. Now nothing fancy here, But with elementary Python, implement a recommendation system. And I didn't know Python beforehand. So I was learning Python for the 1st time and what recommenders were at the at the same time. And I remember that my mind was just blown with how cool this stuff was. I was like, oh my goodness, you can extract Recommendations from simple code and simple math that wasn't confusing. And so I did all the exercises in that PDF, and that was a huge Kind of turning point in my career because I went further down the data science track after that.

00:05:03 Ken: So from that point, How do you go from just picking it up and learning these basic things into a career associated with this field? What are the sort of approximate steps there that you took?

00:05:14 Greg: Sure. So like I said, I started my career off, in finances. So I considered myself a finance person. Right? However, once I found that PDF, I Enrolled in one of the 1st data science boot camps back in 2015. So the concept of a boot camp is well known. There's web development, there's mobile, there's all that stuff. But, if from what I can tell there's this company called Zipfian and Zipfian was the 1st data science boot camp. And so there wasn't a huge data science practice at least in the professional sense. Of course there's academic and there's some very nuanced places, but not in the product growth or user analytics type of sense. And so I took that bootcamp in April 2015 and Python was the main, data analysis language in there. So I I went from a finance guy with a business background to picking up elementary Python. Now, by no means anything production grade, but I could I was I was starting to get pretty good with the Jupyter Notebook and Pandas is is my point. And, and then after that program, which was 3 months full time, 3 months full time, I landed a job at Salesforce, which, I mean, to say it changed my to say that program changed my career is an understatement because not only was I getting paid, more than double what I was getting paid in finance, I was all of a sudden I was working in Salesforce and all the access to all the amazing people within that group. And then the Salesforce name helped me out. And then not only that, but then learning on the job and just surrounding myself with product analytics, was just a huge turning point for me.

00:06:47 Ken: Something I think is Really cool about that that whole approach, like, from boot camp to getting into Salesforce, is that it seems like Each step sort of lended itself to the next one. So the first one, you found this PDF. Right? Yeah. And you're like, wow. This is super interesting. I'm diving in. I know I'm interested in data. I'm gonna go extend to this fascination or this this opportunity that I see here through a boot camp. Right? It's not that, oh, I think this field's cool. I'm just gonna go take this boot camp and spend money and spend 3 months of my time. You got the initial hook because you started doing the work. You started Becoming fascinated with it, it it sort of opened your brain to, oh, there's more here. Maybe I it's inefficient if I learn this myself at the time Rather than going through a more orchestrated system and sort of that initial hook where you were willing to do the work Snowballed into you actually doing the work, learning, landing this awesome job, and being able to do more of that, In that position, it's it's sort of this momentum effect that takes place. And I think so many people, they fall on the other side of that where the where they realize, oh, data science Has a lot of upside. It's a good career. I wanna go do it. And then they don't look and evaluate if they like it to begin with. They just start Diving in whether it's paying money for a boot camp, for a master's degree, whatever it might be. And I feel like there's a lot of burnout in the field, unfortunately, but because of the other side of that phenomenon, you know, Fortunately, my, my story is very similar is that I was building models. I wanted to predict fantasy sports. I realized that there was a Lapse in my technical ability where I was running up against a wall. How do I actually build a model that's not a linear regression? What does it mean? How do I aggregate all this data? I need more technical skills to do this, but I'm started. I'm using Excel, Google Sheets, very elementary r. I'm gonna go back and learn this To accelerate everything from a organized platform. Yeah. But for better, for worse, you know, like the videos you're creating on YouTube, There's more opportunity for learning those things in the wild than there was in 2015. I I know that for sure firsthand.

00:09:09 Greg: Yeah. No. Absolutely. And And funny story about fantasy sports too because I'm as well into pretty into fantasy sports and I was just learning Python, back when I was playing Yahoo Fantasy Football before they had Transaction notifications. Right? I think this was, like, 2018. You didn't know if your teammate or your league mate made a transaction. Like, they dropped a player or picked 1 up. And so I implemented my own homegrown transaction monitor. And I thought to myself, you know, I could do this just for my league, but I'm gonna open I'm gonna do this for everybody. And so I built the app, put it on Reddit, and overnight, I think I had, like, 400 people using my app. Right? Which isn't that much in in practice. But for somebody who doesn't know how to code, putting up this app and getting all of the league data and all the transactions And sending out a ton of emails about different, different occurrences was was pretty cool and pretty exciting. But to your point, that's the beautiful thing is Once you learn a little bit of code and you can start to build your own tools, that is a huge stepping stone within someone's career because then You're not limited. You're only limited by your imagination after that. So all the productivity you want, all the automations that you want are at your fingertips once you learn, this skill set. And And it's interesting to think with the AI trend, and we'll jump into this in a second here, but with the AI trend, how high is that barrier to entry for people making their own tools? Still TBD and we're gonna, we're gonna figure it out.

00:10:32 Ken: Well, I think it's dramatically reducing without a doubt. For example, I just Had a call this morning with 1 of my friends catching up. He was talking about a Bitcoin crypto trading bot that he was building. Yeah. And he doesn't he doesn't know how to code. Maybe very, very elementary. I mean, he's an awesome video director.

00:10:50 Greg: Sure.

00:10:51 Ken: But, he showed me the code. He's like, I wrote this in Pine, which is like, I think one of the trade platform languages.

00:10:58 Greg: Mhmm.

00:10:58 Ken: I had no cloud to use it. And he's he's like, oh, I'll just like turn it into Python code using Gatchabti so you can understand it. And Yeah. To me, That barrier to entry reducing is so cool for anyone who's got that entrepreneurial mindset or philosophy, because it frees up so much. You could, you know, the ability to build is something I would love to be able to democratize. Imagine if everyone who had awesome ideas that could create value in the world, were able to execute on those things. I mean, the world would be maybe a scary place, but also very exciting place as well.

00:11:38 Greg: Yeah. That's exactly. I think the tide would rise for what value means relative value, at least because once you have an influx of a supply of tools, which is really cool, the, the, Everyone's expectations will be higher as well.

00:11:53 Ken: Yeah. So I I wanna get more into your career. But before before we do that, I have a question. I think it's like sort of opportune at the time.

00:12:01 Greg: Yeah.

00:12:01 Ken: You know, talking about the, the Fantasy football application. You shared on Reddit. I hope it's okay if I mentioned this, but you also have another business Kind of in the art space as well. You're making YouTube videos, and, you know, we were talking a little bit about sponsorships and those types of things before. By nature, you seem like unbelievably entrepreneurial. I I really like that. It seems like you're like, hey, how can I scale this? How do I share this? How do I do those things? Where where does that come from?

00:12:33 Greg: I think comes from, You know, I saw a quote from, Andrew Wilkinson that said something along the lines of like, a successful person is just A walking anxiety trait used for productivity or something like that. Or basically, you know, I think it's it comes from 2 things. 1 is a genuine curiosity for how things work. But then, 2, I grew up in Silicon Valley. And with that, you have a lot of success stories that you grow around you, whether it's your friends, whether it's your, whether it's your friends' parents. And so I think that the, The crap, not the crowd, but the kind of the atmosphere that I grew up in as well has always been one where you try things and you're building things and you're sharing things. And And then the minute you get hooked into that world and you jump into the entrepreneurial social media type of space, the number one thing people say you wanna build in public. You wanna build anything. You just wanna ship it out. So I think that it was early on just growing up in the Bay and then eventually just started to snowball and go from there. Now, It may look cool from the outside too. And I think I have a lot of small kind of mini hobby projects that have gone well, and I'm looking for, like, Bigger projects that will be career defining as well. But I tell you what, it's a big long journey and we're having fun along the way.

00:13:53 Ken: I love that you have so many of these projects that are that you're sharing. That's the biggest thing to me Is that if you build something completely in private and you don't share with anyone, there is very little return unless it's, You know, some trading bot or something like that. Yeah. But if you're sharing it, you get input, you get feedback, you can rapidly improve it, make it better, scale it. And to me, that's something that's missing. I, I, in one of the podcasts I did last week, the guy was talking about how he's making a forever project, Right. Where he's just working on this. And that's no different than a company, like a forever project that you share in, in, in, in industry or when you're trying to get a job, like The the line between a personal project and starting a company to me is so blurry, Especially with these new tools that Yeah. Like, why not? I I I love that concept that, like, hey. Like, I was doing this because I loved it. Holy crap. I can, like, make some money from this. And, like, the money comes from advertisers. It doesn't come from, From people that are, for example, like, watching videos or any of those types of things. Like, holy cow. Like, win win. I mean I mean, there's so many opportunities out there. And I I I love that you're Capitalizing on them by doing that building in in public, philosophy or or action set.

00:15:17 Greg: Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what, I think it's pretty well agreed upon that you wanna find what you're passionate about, you wanna build on top of that, and you wanna be able to turn your energy into a job. Right? Everyone knows it. It's a clear roadmap. Yes. However, I found that one of the hardest things in my own life is to identify what I have energy for AKA like, what's your passion and what like, even passion is kind of a hype word right now in the, in the 1st place. But finding something you have energy for Is extremely underrated because I think Paul Graham said it. It's like, get users first. We can worry about how to monetize later. There's a 1000000 ways to monetize. It's kind of like when you're thinking about projects and careers and things you want to work on, it's find whatever it is you have energy for. Don't worry. We'll be able to monetize it later. And, the other the other thing I like to say is, knowing how to do something is pretty straightforward because there's a lot of playbooks out there. There's a lot of experts. There's a lot of advice knowing what to do and what you're excited about. That's the really hard part that folks usually have a hard time for. And even even back even going further, you know, sometimes people would say, Greg, I wanna start a blog. Right? And I say, yeah. Sounds good. No problem. Just know that blog post number 3 or 4 or 5, isn't gonna be the hard part. Blog post 50, 55, 60, 70, that's when it starts to get hard because it's easy to have a spurt of energy for something. But once you need to grind and you have an you need to have endurance, that's a whole different ballpark.

00:16:47 Ken: I love that so much. I mean, there's so many people just like the blog post example on YouTube. They say you haven't even started YouTube till you've made your 100th 100th video. Right? That's when you start getting the hang of it. That's when you start Realizing, oh, who is my audience? How do I serve them better? Do I even enjoy this? Can I do this for this long? And is it sustainable? There's so many factors in that. And I also loved, I think it, you know, so Cal Newport has this whole thing about not following your passions And following your aptitude.

00:17:19 Greg: Mhmm.

00:17:19 Ken: I I don't personally agree with that. I think that there is some hybrid of Aptitude and passion. Right? If you're good at something, you're more likely to continue to do it and get excited about it. Yeah. But the initial spark of doing it, It inherently, I think has to be there. And it has to, you know, like you can feed a spark with aptitude, the spark of, of passion with aptitude. And that's where the magic starts to happen. I I also think there's, like, There there is a path that people can follow.

00:17:55 Greg: Mhmm.

00:17:56 Ken: It's sort of a Morpheus, but, you know, find finding what to do Has always been difficult for a lot of people. But for me, I feel like I've inverted that equation and it's become very easy. Mhmm. Is that I Essentially just follow the edge of what makes me excited, but also uncomfortable, like thinking about the upside or the opportunity or the work, associated with it. Mhmm. And that's a pretty fine line. If it's like way too uncomfortable, you're like, this is completely unrealistic. Probably not along the path. If it's too easy, if it's like, oh, this is, you know, this isn't gonna hold my attention, Probably not worth it. But if it's right on that thin line where, man, this is a big challenge, but holy cow. Mhmm. I'm excited about this. And if I could have, You know, if you think about all the upside potential in terms of value, like, opportunities, all these types of things, But, you know, it's scary because there's a lot to do. There's there's repercussions. What are people gonna think? I've either tricked my brain into being like, that's what I need to do. Uh-huh. Or there's something fundamentally broken in me that I'm not too upset about either way. Sure.

00:19:07 Greg: Do you do you think you honed in on that feeling after you found success as a creator? Or do you think that you had that feeling even early on before any of the view counts, any of the audience was there?

00:19:18 Ken: Z. I think I've always had that. I mean, I had that when I was trying to pursue, for example, professional golf when I was in, in, in Bev before I was, you know, working in industry, that's all I wanted to do was play professional sports.

00:19:33 Greg: Mhmm.

00:19:33 Ken: And To me, that's clear. Very similar thing. It's like, wow. This is so challenging. A lot of people, it sucks because at the low levels, you're You're grinding, you're grinding, and and just to make it, it's it's you know, is it worth the struggle? But the reward, the upside of being able to to accomplish that is so high. But situations do inevitably change. Right? We're not playing with the same data the whole time. Right? Like I had access to more information about my Personal ability as well as, about the the market. And I was like, well, you know, like, if I spend 5 years doing this In a best case scenario, what happens in a worst case scenario? What happens in, like, a a median scenario? What happens? There's a there's inherently, like, a rational part of that equation as well. And for golf, it was it was, like, this is, you know, long term, Probably not the best. I mean, I I still work in professional golf. Mhmm. And I see the lifestyle that players live where they're traveling 30 weeks of the year. You know, they're, they're living out of planes. There's a, there's a lot of, you know, they're very nice planes, but like Would I wanna do that lifestyle compared to, you know, like, probabilistically? Like, if If the 2 options I have are, like, maybe, like, 3 options are, 1, I'm, like, still kicking it around on the mini tours, not making any money. Not a good option, probably highest percentage. Let's say it's 50% chance. Let's say, like another 45% chance. I'm like Middle of the road, playing on, like, developmental tours, making enough money to get by, but still not really comfortable. Mhmm. Or best chance five A percent, which is probably way too high, over a 5 year time horizon. But I'm gonna kudos myself because I could ball a little bit. Like, best chance. It's probably closer to, like, 0.1%. But, we're just gonna say 5%. Sure. The best chance is I'm making a lot of money, but I'm traveling constantly, and I I can't have a lot of the quality of life things that I would really enjoy. Like, the expected value of that entire scenario is just, like, overall, not very good. Whereas if I do what I do now, like, I make on average, like, significantly more money than the average Professional golfer. Mhmm. I have a lot more time freedom. I don't have to travel. I can travel when I wanna get all these benefits. And, like, the aggregate scenario for me working in a domain that I do is significantly higher. That was it's a little bit of a tangent, but, I mean, there's, like, the analytical side And then the, that sort of, I guess, like, feel around where Where I am with the risk and the and the reward and the, and the difficulty that I think really is a good A good driver. This episode of Katzeres Neighbors is brought to you by Z by HP, HP's high compute, workstation grade, a lot of products and solutions. Z is specifically made for high performance data science solutions, and I personally use the ZBook Studio and the z eight workstation. I really love that the z workstations can come standard with Linux or WSL 2, and they can be configured with the data science software stack manager. With the software stack manager, you can get right to the work of doing data science on day 1 without the overhead of having to completely reconfigure your new machine. Now back to our show. So let's dive back. I I really wanna get into, you know, your experience at Salesforce, your experience Sort of branching some of these things off. You had you had such a really such an important conversation with 1 of your managers, if if I remember correctly. And I'd love to learn more about that.

00:23:18 Greg: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So I entered in at Salesforce as a senior analyst on what was called then the product data science team. Now that's just a fancy way of saying, basically, a growth analyst on the product analytics team, and we would partner with different products in Salesforce. So So we were like an internal consulting firm. And the way that we would grow is that we would provide value to our, our partners. So I was partnered with sales and service cloud. And if we did a good job for sales and service cloud, we could make the justification, hey. We are doing 1 1 headcount's worth of value right now. If you want us to do more because there's always more. There's always PMs. There's always features and everything. Fund our team with more headcount and we can do more for you. And that was kinda how we grew as an internal consulting firm. And When I first joined, like I said, I was a senior analyst. And, usually, data people, they have a choice to make when they get further in their career. They can go deeper down the technical route Or they can go towards the man managerial route, which can still be technical, but not nearly as much. And because of my business background, I chose to go down the managerial track. And so then I started to move into the manager position where I was managing analysts, but then also data engineers, data scientists, some visualization people and some strategy people. And, I left Salesforce on on the same team, still on the strategy and growth team. But as I was leaving Salesforce and this was to go, kind of take a personal sabbatical. So that was my, impetus for coming out. And I tried or even backing up from there. I asked the question, hey, if I'm if I'm about to leave corporate, what do I want my last 60 days to look like? Right? Who do I wanna talk to? What benefits do I wanna take advantage of right now? Or, like, how do I just wanna optimize this time? Because once you leave and your email's closed off, You're out of the club. You're you're not you're not with them anymore. Right? So I set up a bunch of 1 on ones with a whole bunch of people, a lot of people that I respected, It's kind of say my, my goodbyes. And, one of my mentors there, I won't say who, I was having my closing 1 on 1 with her and she said, Hey, Greg, I think that you should shoot to be more than the data person. And I was kind of taken aback. I was kind of taken back by that statement and I I I said, what do you mean? Why? She goes, well, data the data that you're doing right now, you're advising the decision maker. You're not the decision maker on these things. And I thought to myself, man, yeah, that's true because I would advise finance on the recommendation on what action I think they should do or the action I think marketing should do or the GM or the product people. And as always my advice or recommendation, it was not I was never the one actually making the proper decision. And so from that point in my career, I thought to myself, okay. I need to kind of steer myself more Away from that position, because it wasn't necessarily one I wanted to go deeper down and something more towards on the decision making side. And, This is always another huge question which we could have an entire podcast on is when you're a data analyst, what are the career options in front of you, and what are the different routes that you can go and explore? And so I asked myself that question many times, and the route that I found myself naturally drawn to was an operations track. So heading towards the COO realm. And if you think about why it's like, well, COO, they see internal processes and they need to speed them up. They need to make them efficient. Right? They see a lot of data. Sometimes product rolls into finance, I mean, into the COO. Sometimes finance rolls into there. And there's a lot of numbers. There's a lot of efficiencies and there's a lot of making sure that tools and orchestration is working internally within a company. And so After I left Salesforce and I was looking for my next job, I knew I wanted to go to the startup route. And so I joined Digits as their 1st business hire, which is a Fintech company. And I told the founders from on for early on, it's like, hey, here's what I did at Salesforce. Here's what I'm gonna crush for you in the beginning. I have no doubt about that, but I'm gonna steer my career in this direction. And this is the position I wanna grow into, which is much more on the operation side. And the founders were down for that. So I ended up being a good fit for me.

00:27:24 Ken: There's so much great stuff in that. I mean, you know, starting from the end or maybe Working forward. I love that you kinda told them what you were looking for. Something that so many people Fall into. Right? Is that they say, hey. Hey. I just want a new role. I just wanna work at x, y, z company. They don't put thought into what they wanna make out of that opportunity. Yeah. And if you really think about it, telling an employer what you expect and what you would like to get out of a role and where you would like to go, it helps them Do a better job at keeping you happy. It helps them do a better job of giving you projects that you're excited about. It's legitimately a win win, especially after you've already Landed a job. Yeah. And I think that that's so overlooked by so many people. I am also interested in if you're comfortable talking about it, can you talk about why you took The sabbatical off, like, what were some of the things you were thinking? Like, hey. This is a good idea. I wanna take time. And and what was the reasoning behind that?

00:28:23 Greg: You know, it was, I was in a grind at Salesforce too, and it had nothing to do with Salesforce as the company per se, but it was Just it was it was a corporate environment. And I saw that my learning curve, what the next call it 5 or 6 years looked like in that single role, in that single position, wasn't exactly what I wanted to continue on doing. Now I had a few options in my in in front of me. I could go try to find another position within Salesforce, Or I could take some time off and kind of live the romantic life of going and traveling and going from there. But I chose the latter with my then girlfriend, now wife at the time, we ended up going and living in Bali for a little bit. And I worked on a bunch of projects, basically, from what we were talking about earlier. The the last thing that I'll say too is just general advice or tip that I learned Is there was a period of time at Salesforce when my immediate manager, went to another position. So I was reporting into my manager's manager. Right? And at the when I first started there, I thought to myself, man, this is gonna be really cool. I'm gonna get really awesome exposure to who has been the SVP. Right? However, the type of management that SVPs do is not the type of management that I needed in my position. They're very strategic, very, you know, long term thinking. And at that point in my career, I needed a bit more day to day types of help. And so, it ended up not being a great situation for me and it added a bit more friction to it. So that was another reason why, the impetus to leave as well.

00:29:57 Ken: No. I I mean, I think that that makes sense. I also think that If you think about how you got in, you know, like, this is such a great opportunity. It's completely transformed your career. Mhmm. It was great to work then, But there are things about that role that maybe weren't the best fit for what you wanted long term. I mean, like the ability to be A decision maker

00:30:19 Greg: Mhmm.

00:30:20 Ken: In Salesforce, the barrier to entry to do that is probably a lot higher than at a startup. Also, the overhead associated with that. I mean, startups, you can have tremendous impact as a decision maker. At Salesforce, maybe you can, But there's so many checks and balances that those decisions sort of got watered down over time Compared to what you what you might feel at a smaller company.

00:30:45 Greg: Yeah. And I was gonna say that I was gonna say the thing that just to tack onto that is We talk about expected value of it too. That's the other side of the coin. The expected value of me becoming a decision maker at Salesforce is pretty high if you just follow down the track. Right? What What you're talking about with the startup problem, yes, you can become a decision maker quicker, but your expected value of Success is so much lower that it's a it's a complete different side of the coin.

00:31:14 Ken: Yeah. Well, I I think that that all plays into individual risk appetite too. Yeah. You know what I mean? I I I think that from talking to you, I I would like to think I'm this way as well, but there's an interest in taking, like, calculated small risks To see what the upside is.

00:31:34 Greg: Mhmm.

00:31:35 Ken: And in the scope of a career, I think a lot of people also don't realize that taking a new job Isn't as big a risk is a lot of people think, especially if you already have established career,

00:31:47 Greg: you

00:31:47 Ken: know, you're already a good company going to work for a startup. If it didn't work out, You could go maybe even work back at Salesforce again. Yeah. You could go work somewhere else. There's exit opportunities Once you've established a proof of work, once you've gotten a certain skill set maybe for interviewing down Mhmm. That really frees you up because there's so much fear around, oh, like, What if x, y, z happens? I mean, expected value, yes. But if you factor in the, remarketability of yourself into that expected value, that does actually change the risk equation.

00:32:24 Greg: Yeah. That's exactly it. And in fact, I got my startup job via a cold email to the founder, which is like a 4 line cold email, which, you know, the other big lesson within my career that I've seen is around storytelling. Right? And it's amazing the power of storytelling and copywriting and what it can do for you. So, you're right when a with a current you're right when you say that the name of Salesforce also helped me out a ton.

00:32:49 Ken: You mind if I ask roughly what was in that email?

00:32:52 Greg: Yeah. So I was leaning back on the Salesforce name, And I'll tell you I'll tell you right now because this is a this is a good one. Yeah. So I emailed, one of the founders and I said, founder, my My name is Greg, and I was previously director of strategy and growth at Salesforce leading our sales and service analytics teams. Congratulate congratulations on the recent funding for digits. I want to help accelerate your growth. Do you mind if I send you my resume and bullet points to see if it's a good fit? And so the reason Nice.

00:33:32 Ken: It was elegant.

00:33:33 Greg: Just nice and short. The resume, sure, because that's just standard. But then I said, do you want me to put bullet points? Because no exec wants to read a resume. I mean, really, they want the TLDR. And so I and then he didn't even respond to the first one. I had to follow-up with him again. And he was like, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's let's see what let's basically see what you got. And so I sent it over to him, and that started

00:33:54 Ken: the conversation. Yeah. I mean, I I think the first thing let's dissect that a little bit. I mean, the first thing you led with was a proof of work.

00:34:02 Greg: Yeah. Accenture. It's basically. Right.

00:34:04 Ken: Yeah. Yeah. This is what I've done. This is what I could do for you is a very compelling argument structure. And I think that's easier to do than a lot of people realize if you built a cool personal project, that's relevant to a domain. You can say, Hey, I built this dashboard. Like, it's something I've done. Check it out. Yeah. And if you like it, let's talk about how I could do something like that for your company. It's it's I I really love how short and concise. I mean, It's to the CEO. You have to be respectful of their time. You have to have some mystery in those types of things. And, I I wish there was, more examples of really good good ways to connect just like that.

00:34:47 Greg: Yeah. Right after I left Zipfian, I did a video about my job searching process and how I landed at Salesforce. And the number 1 lesson throughout that entire thing is Don't apply through the front door. Careers.uber.comcareers.lift.com. That's you're sending your resume into an abyss there. I put all of my energy into cold emails to recruiters and hiring managers. I got more responses and more hit rates from that, than 200 applications into random career pages. It it's just that it's just not the way it works. Oh, yeah. Same goes for LinkedIn. Don't apply on LinkedIn. It just does not does not work at all.

00:35:29 Ken: Yeah. I I completely agree. Especially early in the career. Right? If you don't have

00:35:32 Greg: that for sure. Yeah.

00:35:33 Ken: Yeah. One of my good Brent is actually out in Hawaii right now. Jeff Lee, he collected data on his entire job search. And so he found early in his career 100% Cold email outreach, like different channels where the competition was lower. Yep. 100% has A significantly better return. We're talking like 100% better outcomes. But when he was later in his career after he worked a couple of data science jobs, He found that the traditional routes, he was actually having success because if you're thinking about mid level data scientists, How many are actually out there compared to junior level data scientists?

00:36:15 Greg: Sure.

00:36:16 Ken: The the the total market applying for these roles It's just it's significantly lower because there just aren't that many people that have the amount of experience in a domain that's still relatively new. I mean, Like, I feel like I've been in this domain for a long time, and I started in 2015 just like you. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Where it's like, you know, if we're applying for jobs, how many other people are also in The market with that amount of experience also applying, it's a it's a pretty interesting paradigm. But at the same time, he was finding that he was now having roughly Cool success with those 2. If you're thinking about the job market, which I think is a min max equation, right? So Your goal is not to be the 80th percentile candidate in every role. Your job or goal is to be the best Candidate in some roles and maybe even the worst candidate in some roles. Right? Like, if you're the best candidate in 3 and the very worst candidate in the other 30. Mhmm. You're probably gonna get a job. Yeah. Right? And, you know, how do you do that? Probably something that's personalized or outreach Or that isn't whatever you want else is doing, is gonna give you, disproportionate returns. Yeah. I

00:37:31 Greg: mean, the that type of job hunting is just like a sales funnel. And coming from a growth background, if you break it down just like a funnel, You can see exactly where your problems are. So if somebody tells me they have a hard time getting a job, I just start at the top of the funnel. I say, how's your outbound? What do you mean? What's what do you mean what outbound? Alright. Well, there you go. There's the problem. You know? And then it's like, okay, what's your response rate on your outbound? Oh, you know, it's 1%. Okay. Well, I think that could be a little bit higher. And you just go down. It's, like, how many phone calls have you had with a recruiter? How many have you had with a hiring manager? How many have, you know, 2nd round, you know, blah, blah, blah. And then you can really just diagnose where the problem is. And I would say that most folks, they have a volume problem at the top of the funnel. They're not doing enough outbound. And then it's also a conversion problem on that outbound so their sales pitch or their email or their online persona is not curated enough that recruiters are rejecting them, before they even reply.

00:38:27 Ken: That is one of the most valuable things. I think anyone listening who's looking for a job can evaluate is collect data on this process. Figure out just like any other Analysis you do figure out where the where the bottleneck is. Figure out where it's failing. I mean, you have people that are sending out a 1,000 Resumes or applying to a 1000 jobs and not having any success. Well, it's not the outbound. Yeah. What Part of the process is breaking down. You're not getting emails back. We'll fix your resume. Yeah. Fix your outreach. Go to different channels. There's There's very rarely ever in that process something that isn't actionable that you could be doing better. And a lot of the times, people defer to, oh, I'm just gonna send more out. I'm gonna increase the volume Because that's the easiest thing to do. Once you get in the groove of sending out resumes, you're like, oh, I have something to show for it. Yeah. But sitting down and saying, okay. My resume isn't good for these reasons. I I need to improve this. Get you know, I'm gonna get feedback from 4 of my friends, from a data scientist I know to to make this more compelling. That's hard. Yeah. That that's that's difficult in comparison, but it has, again, disproportionate returns associated with that.

00:39:42 Greg: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And on that point where you said people fall back on what's easy for them. I'm I was on the My First Million podcast, Sam Parr said a line that was just that hit me a lot. He goes, people or looking for excuses as to why something didn't work out for them or something like that. I don't know what it is. They're looking for permission to not put an energy into something. And so if you only do what's easy for you and you don't do what's hard or what's differentiated, you're not gonna end up getting what you want in the 1st place.

00:40:14 Ken: That is such a good line. Yeah. I I think it it falls into this overarching concept. I I firmly believe that most people, They really know what they should do. Mhmm. A lot of the times, success, whether it's in the job search, whether it's in entrepreneurship, whether it's in anything, It is simple. Mhmm. You do certain things and you get the returns. Mhmm. People conflate simple with easy, though. A lot of the time, very simple things are unbelievably difficult. Mhmm. And that's something that Is overlooked constantly. If you can do simple things and do the difficult tasks to get those simple things done

00:40:54 Greg: Mhmm.

00:40:56 Ken: Then you can have success. Yeah. But the the easy things don't always lead To the to the proportionate return. Or they do get proportionate return. Like, easy easy things,

00:41:08 Greg: small return. And isn't it weird how You can give someone else advice and if you looked at someone else and they had your situation you'd be like, it's a no brainer on what you should do. You need to do x, y, and z. But when it's your own situation, you get almost tunnel vision or you get, you know, almost like the fog of war. And it's really tough to have a fresh perspective. So That's why it's so good talking to people on the outside who have that fresh perspective and who can tell you, with a bit more clarity on what to do.

00:41:35 Ken: Yeah. That that's something I I 100% fall into that trap. Yeah. Without a doubt Yes. That is something that That I, I face almost on a daily basis. I think outside looking in is really powerful. Mhmm. I also think that people that you're closest to, your inner circle, Those are the people that are supposed to be telling you, Hey, you, you could be doing this so much better. Yeah. You could be, you could be maximizing and you're not doing the hard simple things.

00:42:14 Greg: Yeah.

00:42:14 Ken: I I have 2 friends that hold me accountable like that directly, And I don't know what I would do without them, because people who are too far out, they're they don't wanna, like, Mess up your stuff.

00:42:27 Greg: Sure.

00:42:27 Ken: They don't they're usually hesitant to be too critical, unless they're random commenters on YouTube or TikTok or

00:42:33 Greg: something like that.

00:42:34 Ken: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Switching topics to YouTube and TikTok. Mhmm. Or more just YouTube. Yeah. So, You know, obviously I was introduced to you through Langchain.

00:42:47 Greg: Mhmm.

00:42:47 Ken: How did you get so excited about that technology? What is it about that technology That is so compelling for you.

00:42:55 Greg: Yeah. So back at digits, Like I said, I moved my career over to the operations track. And what that entailed was figuring out many automations, like, in work. Right? So how do you hook up Zapier to do this? How do you get the analytics engine to start working or whatever? And you combine that with my Python skill set that I learned early on my career. Building tools is just fun. Right? It's just so cool to build something and then see it work for you. Right? And so that was baked into me. And I had an I had an earlier experience teaching people how to do data analysis on, YouTube. So I think it was 2 or 3 years ago, I started a YouTube channel called Data Independent and I just made Pandas tutorials. Right? So what I did was I had a lit the top 60 Pandas functions by Google search. How, like the, volume of search, per per month, checking HRFs or SEM rush or whatever. And I just started at the top And I went all the way down and I just did a blog post, a video, a code sample, well, those 3 for each one of those different, functions. And there's 60 of them so I pounded 1 out per day for 2 months and I was trying to do the SEO play. Right? I put it on autopilot for, like, 2 years. SEO went up. It was great. Couple sponsors, not bad. Flash forward to January of this year, January 2023, and I see on Hacker News The launch post for Langchain. And I've later talked to Harrison, told him that was very influential for me. He goes, We didn't even post that. Somebody else posted that. Alright. Whatever. But either way, I saw it in January because the 1st PR for Langchain was in October of 22. And when I saw that, As you know, hacker news can be kind of, grumpy sometimes with new technologies and they kind of rag on new technologies. And The comment section was like really into Linkedin and I was like, I still have no idea what this thing is. I go to the documentation. It's tough to figure it out. I'm not so sure. I look on YouTube, there's no tutorials on LinkedIn. And I thought to myself, oh my goodness, this is so cool. Right? And I had tried experimenting with the OpenAI API itself, and I was running into all the problems that Langchain had solved. So, the problem of chunking, The problem of connecting to other data sources, the, you know, just x, y, z, all that stuff. And I thought to myself, man, this framework is really, really cool. And I wanna learn how to do it. And so I think one of my first either tweets or videos was I'm going on a journey to learn how to build really cool, impactful AI applications. Come along with me on this journey, if you want to, Learn with me, basically. And so I ended up doing a whole bunch of content for it. And, it's been a really fun journey since then. Now Connecting it back to what we talked about earlier in the podcast, sharing in public. I never really considered myself a content person, right? Until this year. And It's been it's been unreal. It's been surreal. I mean, the amount of inbound opportunities has been awesome. The amount of meeting cool people who are interested in the AI space has just been really cool And I'm just so thankful for, the opportunities that have been presented and it, and I'm, I'm, I'm not stopping. Like it's, it's just been way too fun. So now, as long as I can sustain myself financially with this journey, we're gonna keep on doing good stuff.

00:46:15 Ken: Amazing. Well, I really must say, I think you do have a gift for teaching. I've went through quite a few of your Lang chain tutorials, I think minimum 7 or 8 of them. And they've been unbelievably helpful because when I was going through I just recently built an app where I hopefully obsolete myself from having to answer YouTube comments. We'll we'll find we'll find out. But what what I found was that, honestly, the lang Langchain documentation, It's very clean and it's very nice, but it didn't it's it has massive gaps in Explaining certain concepts. And I was going through your videos. I was going through some of the basic workbooks you had, and you quite eloquently described A lot of the core functionality, which I think is sort of overlooked. I I had to go to the JavaScript documentation, Interpret it and then bring that to Python for a lot of, some of the small nuts and bolts of things. And that, to me, Being able to view your stuff in combination with that, they also have a chatbot that's built into the documentation that was only sort of helpful. Yeah. I I I would I would have thought that would have been a lot better based on Yeah. Totally. The technology.

00:47:33 Greg: I was gonna say, I tell you what, I think part of the reason why That's the case is because, you know, I told you my background earlier. I'm not technical by trade. Right? I'm not a software engineer. And I tell people all the time, I'm not gonna be your production grade engineer to get you to, you know, 99.99 uptime. Right? My background and my passion is in b two b products and delivering value to customers. So if I'm gonna teach a technical topic, I need it to be dead simple. Like, I need it to speak like English. So some of my code you'll see it right to is not the most optimized. It's gonna be slow, But it's gonna be so simple that you can understand and kinda read it like a book because if I don't have it that simple, then I don't understand it either. So I think that That's another, differentiator that people resonate with with content wise.

00:48:22 Ken: I think that's really important. Something That I've learned from teaching as a professor on the Internet and doing stuff like that is that you need to have empathy with the students. And a lot of college professors or particularly computer science professors I've had, they have no semblance Of the thought process of any of their students. They're completely detached. They've been in academia their entire lives. They learned these concepts 25 years ago, and it's second nature to them. And when you're learning a new tool, whether it's The beginning of programming or anything, a teacher being able to resonate with that journey Is something that can go a really long way. And that's something that that I'm even realizing now is, oh my goodness. I'm, like, kind of detached from The very beginner data science questions that I used to have. Putting myself back in my shoes of, oh, you know, why would I even do this? Why would I read in a file this way? Why would I make a pivot table or do something very basic for me now? I don't even think about it. But, Fortunately, YouTube comments give me feedback and, and Ken Wands and Kaggle and those types of things. But it's really important for teachers to be able to have that ability to relate. And it's cool that your business background sort of ties in directly to that.

00:49:45 Greg: Yeah. And every creator too, they have a choice about what type of audience member do they wanna serve. And so I've strategically Not gone to the here's how you install Anaconda. Here's how you install Python. I I let other creators and other people do that stuff. It's once you open a Jupyter Notebook, Let's go. Game on. We're gonna have some fun and and go from there.

00:50:06 Ken: Yeah. I think there is beauty in niching down and specialization in content. I mean, For their tutorial videos, for for the maybe not the how to walk through an analysis, but how to install things, how to configure things. There's gonna be people Well, they're going to do it better than both of us. Probably both of us combined. Right. But for actually walking through those things, you can really make a massive impact Right there. And, you know, I've seen it. I've been able to build some pretty cool stuff very, very much because of of your digital help. Nice. I I think something that would be useful, and we talked a lot about lang chain. Could you just describe what it is? Because for a lot of people Hearing about it, there still might be a barrier to entry because they're like, oh, it sounds confusing. Wish it kinda is, but it conceptually, it's not.

00:50:56 Greg: Sure. So let me do it at a few different levels of abstraction. Z. Lang, let me put this. Langchain is to what what pandas is to doing data analysis. Langchain is to helping build AI applications. Cool. What is what is Langchain? Langchain is a series of abstractions packaged up in a Python library that makes working with language models easy to do. Right? What is Langchain? Langchain is an easy way to develop AI applications. So what it what it means in I mean, in English here is basically, a lot of the hard parts that you'll run into if you just interact with the OpenAI API, It like the raw one itself or any other language model API, you're gonna quickly run into a series of problems. First one is gonna be context limit. You're gonna try to put in a 50 page book into a prompt. And you're gonna get an error back from the API that says, hey, you tried doing too much here.

00:51:58 Ken: Too big. Right.

00:51:59 Greg: So yeah. So what do you do? Oh, well, I'm gonna split up my document and I'm gonna make a 4 loop and then I'm gonna chunk it and then I'm gonna try to put it in piece by piece. Well, instead of you doing that yourself with vanilla Python, there's libraries that are specialized in this and Langchain is one of those. Now Langchain is open source. That means that you can go and check out the code on GitHub yourself. I frequently need to go into their source code and go check out different parameters or whatever whatever it may be. Lang chain was one of the first frameworks out there, and it's Super interesting to see some of the lang chain decisions get permeate per per permeate throughout the industry. So The lang chain was one of the 1st groups to allow you to connect external data sources to a language model. Right? And I don't know how many months Head start they had on it, but then all of a sudden OpenAI has plugins come around and they mentioned Langchain in the plugin blog post launch blog post. Super, super interesting. Right? So Langchain is an what is Langchain? Langchain is an awesome community of builders that is in the forefront of building with AI. And because it's open sourced, you get a lot of really cool integrations and a lot of really cool abstractions that are on the tip of the spear for building language models.

00:53:15 Ken: That's such a good definition. I also think lang chain is very in line with the overarching Trends that we're seeing in data science and AI. So something that I've observed is that outsourcing models in particularly Is gonna be a massive trend. So rather than have in house data scientists building a model Mhmm. Like, oh, I trained this large language model myself. We're gonna be outsourcing a lot of that to third party models, OpenAI to Google, whatever it might be. The problem is that Those models are not specific to our data. But for us to retrain one of these large language models, it would be prohibitively expensive. It would be overly complex. And for most of these companies, it's completely privatized, so we would not be able to do that. Llama, it's a little bit different. But Langchain allows us to essentially use our own data to integrate and chain prompts together To make all of these models relevant for our specific use cases. And to me, that's the direction where I see a lot of this stuff going is Most companies don't have the firepower to train these massive models. And if all of these models are becoming multimodal and and having so many Things that you could do with them, you're just gonna need 1 or 2 models to do everything, and you build infrastructure on that. And lang chain is that infrastructure that allows us To build and make these things into actual products like you described. And I I mean, I see so much upside. I mean, I don't know if lang chain is necessarily Gonna be what does it. There might be another framework that does something very similar that is more widely adopted or whatever it might be.

00:54:59 Greg: Mhmm.

00:54:59 Ken: But I There's been very few packages where I've seen the immediate utility in how to create products rather than projects, right out of the gate. I I mean, you you got me really excited when I loved talking about this now.

00:55:14 Greg: Totally. Yeah. Absolutely. And I like, I like dissecting. Like like why did line chain rise so quickly to the top? Right? I think, I mean, this may be a bit of an overstatement, but, like, the vibe on Twitter with people sharing their projects It is absolutely massive. And not only that, Langchain isn't some, like, project in the background where it's like some back end service that doesn't make any sense to anybody. You can show your line chain project to your grandmother. Right? You can show it to your mom. You can show it to your brother or whoever it may be. And It's gonna it could potentially immediately provide value to that person. So I think that line chain rose so quickly because People were making impactful demos. That's it. Impactful demos on Twitter that shared really well and went viral extremely quickly. So, like, There was a time when it was, novel and extremely cool to connect a PDF to chat gpt. Right? Like, today, it's like, oh, no big deal. Everybody and their mother's doing that. But there's a time when that was a really big deal. Right? People did that for all the different domains and all the different niches. And so all of a sudden, software engineers from finance, from auto, from health care, from aviation, from everywhere are Wondering, how do I do this for my own data? And so they jumped on the trend and LaneChain was the one that did it for him. There's a lot of other libraries out there that help connect data like LAMA index. And, and it's just it's super interesting to see how this industry is evolving both in the open source and the closed source side.

00:56:48 Ken: Yeah. I mean, you can even obstruct that All the way up to how ChatGPT works is that anyone can use ChatGPT. If you can use Google, if you can type into a box, you can use it. So I taught I gave a lecture about sort of the future of AI to, PolySci class the other day. And those these none of these people are Necessarily, like, super tech literate compared to a software engineer or something along those lines. And they're saying, okay, if AI is gonna be this powerful technology, How do I show my grandma? How do I show my mom the how to use this? How do how do I where do they start with this technology? Mhmm. And the beauty of these technologies, at least with ChatGVT and in some sense, language training, is you can start with the technology itself. You can just open a web page And show someone chatty bb and say, Hey, you can type into it and it'll respond. The intuitiveness of that compared to almost any other technology Technological invention is unparalleled. When you think of an iPhone, you have to learn how to how to use a smartphone. You have to Understand the haptics. You have to do all these things. You for the Internet, same thing. You have to understand how to open a web browser. You have to do all these things. This innovation is more accessible than any large scale innovation maybe in history. And Very, very exciting.

00:58:11 Greg: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the reason why they went to a 100,000,000 so quickly.

00:58:16 Ken: Yeah. So you talked about the actual technology. Let's get into nuts and bolts. What are some of the ways you could see a Lang chain In tandem with some of these large models creating value, you know, in terms of products, in terms of opportunities. Do you have specific examples if there's secret sauce that, You know, you don't have to spill that but I know you have a bunch of tutorials where you're doing actual use cases.

00:58:41 Greg: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so Let let's just let's just talk about a few big buckets here. So one of the big buckets that I personally like, I'm not sure why, but is around transcripts and spoken word. Right? So I made a project where I would analyze sales calls with a language model, and I would extract information that was relevant to the salesperson. What are the next steps? What are the follow ups? What are the pain points of the customer? Right? Etcetera, etcetera. Huge, massive there. I'm knee deep in podcast work right now as well. So doing topic extraction from podcasts. And so one of my partners, they have 400 podcasts on that on their on their series there. And And there's a bunch of business ideas and life advice and product recommendations and quotes that are just sitting on that podcast in unstructured form and they're not taking advantage of it. Right? And so to be able to extract that information and get it ready for the content engine, so go and make shorts, go and make, you know, ads or whatever it may be. I mean, clear clear use case extracting that stuff. Another huge one that I love personally is around idea generation. So if I have a goal and I wanna do something, the language model has no doesn't have my internal bias when I'm, trying to figure out ways that I can do something. Right? So I often tell the model, hey. Can you give me 10 ideas to complete this goal? And 8 of them are no good. I mean, they're gibberish. Right? One of them isn't bad, but the last one really inspires some energy in me to go and do something. Right? And then all of a sudden I get, like, little butterflies and I Oh, yeah. This is such a cool idea. I wanna go ahead and do this one. Really, really powerful there. But then the the part that I've saved for last here is is where everybody's talking about it is truly on the decision making side. So on the using a language model as a reasoning engine, which still Blows my mind that that's the case. So we saw the early demos of like an auto GPT or a baby AGI which blew everybody away, But then there's a little bit of mismanaged expectations because they're not as valuable as they may want them to be in its current state today. I have no doubt that they will be eventually. It's really cool to see the browser automation work that's happening with companies like MultiOn and with companies like Adept. Though I'm I'm still waiting. I would love to see what Adept is up to recently because I haven't heard much from them. So I think browser automation is a huge huge one. And then The other piece that gets me really excited is around thinking about how big companies like Salesforce, Intuit, enter Amazon, You know, Microsoft, Google's, how are they gonna use language models internally? And what does their own internal plug in architecture look like? Right? And who's managing those internal plug ins? And is that a new class of developer? Because that's kind of like what, I forget the the the fellow's name. But he put out that blog post around the AI engineer. That's the new job title that's gonna be coming around. Those people are gonna be managing internal plugins for b to b operations as as well, which I think is gonna be super, super cool. But then not only that, the last thing I'll say here is I started noticing on Twitter that a lot of people were forcing chat gpt for interesting use cases. So people on Twitter would say, oh, I use chat gpt for therapy or I use it to generate bedtime stories for my kid or I use it for argument formation, like, I'm about to present something to my boss and I wanna know what questions he may have so I can better my argument or whatever. And so I collected all those ideas and And I have a Notion doc of, like, a 100 different ideas of people using chat TBD for super interesting use cases out in the wild. And Right now I think the limit for doing more is really around reliability because these things aren't as deterministic as we need, and People's imagination with it too. The last thing I'll finish up with is I don't think that The limiting factor on more tech progress with LLMs is GPT four's reasoning ability. I think that It is fine for right now, but we are extremely immature on the superstructures that interact with GPT four and that there's a lot of room to go there. So even if GPT Ford stayed at the exact same reasoning ability that it is today, You give us another 5 years. The world is completely different. Even with GPT four, we don't need GPT 5678 quite yet.

01:03:02 Ken: Yeah. I tend to agree with you wholeheartedly. I think that the immaturity in the infrastructure It is something that will I mean, that's gonna change relatively fast. Mhmm. And I see the writing on the wall of how much Good infrastructure means for creating products and value and opportunity. I'm seeing it in my own mind. Just using Linechain a little bit, I've been able to create something that I already know will create value for myself and for anyone who's watching, for example, my videos. And so it's like, wow. I mean, If I can do that in a weekend, what can someone with a lot more motivation and firepower do To impact and scale to significantly more people. And, also, Ken's Nearest Neighbors podcast always, Well, you know, always happy to be an early alpha tester for any topic modeling you do in the podcast space. So

01:03:58 Greg: Yeah. Well, I tell you what, I'm making the script I'm making the script right now. The the biggest pain in the butt with this entire thing is just data processing, getting the files, making sure they're organized, and setting up the structure itself. Then language model part is the easy part. So, let's chat later and we'll we'll try it out.

01:04:15 Ken: Heck yeah. So those are all the questions I had. You know, something that, z. I would love to hear is if you have any advice for people who are interested in learning more about Lang chain, interested in Maybe more of a future, as a decision maker as well, on the way out. And then what's the best way people can learn more and hear From you.

01:04:39 Greg: Nice. Well, let's take those 3 just 1 by 1 there. If you wanna get started with Langchain, I made I literally made 2 2 videos to Answer that exact question. So video number 1 is just the Langchain 7 core use cases. Now that is just I'm sorry. I think 7 core concepts. That one is just like the 7 ways that people are interacting with language models. It's the 7 abstractions that you're gonna wanna know the most. I would watch that first. There's a corresponding code notebook that's open source. You can go grab it. Run it all on your own. The 2nd video is the line chain 9 use cases. So you learn the nuts and bolts, but then what do you do with them? Well, you do summarizing. You do question and answering. You do extraction and tagging and all that, etcetera, etcetera. Go watch that next. After those 2 videos, you're gonna be very well prepared with the nuts and bolts to go make your own project, which is really step 3. Go pick something that interests you, Go connect one of your own documents. Go build a question and answer bot and go have some fun and then put it on Twitter and share publicly. Right? That's That's the way I would recommend that people get started with LinkedIn. Now, the 2nd question around how do you become more on the decision maker side of the house? It's really being intentional about your career. Because if you're not in the decision making standpoint right now and you want to be, well, that means that you're gonna have to make a shift in your career. And the best way that you can do that is through intentionality. And looking at people who are a few years ahead of you and figuring out Who do I wanna be like? And whose career do I wanna go and model after and figure out how to get from a to b? And if you're like, well, I really don't know where to start. It may be trite but go ask chat g p t. This is my current career. This is where I wanna go. What are 10 ways that I can go and do it? And like I said 8 of those ways are gonna be bogus but 2 of them are gonna maybe get you excited and make you, start to go do it.

01:06:24 Ken: Yeah. But before you get into the last one, I think something that's, It's a little bit funny is the intentionality, it goes hand in hand with decision making. Right? If you want to be a decision maker, You have to make decisions about your career, and you have to think about them and actually act on them. So it's sort of, in some sense, a self fulfilling prophecy In a in a in a unique way.

01:06:48 Greg: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's exactly it. And then lastly, if you wanna get a hold of me, my Put our DMs are open. That's where I respond to a whole bunch of people. That's a great spot. If not, you can go on my regular website, which is contact at dataindependent.com. Or lastly, throw up a YouTube comment, but I don't respond to all of them depending on the question from there. But either way, I love talking to folks. And, If somebody gives me a well formulated question, I generally respond. If you throw me your Python bug in a YouTube comment, and you say, why isn't this working? I generally won't respond.

01:07:26 Ken: Rules of thumb, if you wanna get a hold of them Via cold email, make sure you do your homework because he's he's pretty good at them too. So, Greg, I will put all of the links You described in the description to the video and also in the show notes so people can find you more easily. This was awesome. Thank you so much for coming on. I loved the conversation and I learned a lot.

01:07:46 Greg: Awesome, Ken. Thank you very much, man.
